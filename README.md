# web_scraping
This is a WebScraper that currently only scrapes Craigslist for motorcycles. *(I made this to help me sift through all the bookmarks I had when looking for a motorcycle for myself)


You can download the files into a directory on any unix based machine running python3,
run the following command using a terminal, from the directory containing all the files from this repo:

python3 clist_motorcycle_scraper.py
