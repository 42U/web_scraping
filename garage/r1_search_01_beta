Finally letting go of my favorite bike of all time.  This is a 2003 Yamaha R1 with Ohlins front suspension, FULL Akrapovic titanium exhaust, power commander, steering stabilizer, and only 14,000 miles.  I'm an older guy and 2nd owner - this bike has never been down, raced, abused, stunted, etc.  It's in excellent condition.  Spark Plugs just replaced (this over $200), good tires (Michelin Power Pilot) ready to roll. Front fairing is not the original - it cracked right at the mirror but I still have it so you can see the bike was not laid down.

2002 Yamaha R1 with 16k original miles. Excellent condition never wrecked or down. This is my baby and it has been meticulously maintained. It runs and rides like a new bike. It has like new Michelin Pilot tires, FMF exhaust, frame sliders, rear cowl + seat, and integrated brake light and turn signals. It also comes with 2 other exhausts and a tank bag. Oil changed 400 miles ago. This bike needs nothing but a rider. No trades and no rides without cash in hand. I'm only selling it because I need the room and ride my Harley more.

Up for sale is my '07 R1 sport bike. It has been regularly maintained with synthetic Mobil 1 racing 4T motor oil only. This bike has <15k on the clock. The fork suspension has just been serviced, with new seals, boots, and oil. The gearing has been changed from OEM to a "power up" configuration, shifting the power band to a more effective, user-friendly (and much more fun) range. This bike has a wet weight of 480 lbs, and has 156 base horsepower. It has Michelin Pilot Power 2CT tires (my favorite for this kind of bike) with plenty of meat left on em. It has some aftermarket features, including custom fairings, custom rear sets, and a few other things. This bike is street legal, with current registration till May, 2019. I'm motivated to sell, so will consider any REASONABLE offer. For a quick sale I'm asking $5000 or best offer. Test ride with collateral (cash or otherwise) and a valid M1 class license only.

2006 Yamaha R1 with 5,031 miles -$5000- Clean with lots of goodies

$5000

QR Code Link to This Post


I am selling a 2006 Yamaha R1 with 5031 miles.  It used to be a dedicated track bike, which is why it has such low mileage.  It has a clean title and is Non-OP'd, so it can easily be converted back to a street bike if wanted.  The bike comes with an extra, brand new set of Bridgestone BT002's.  This bike is in near immaculate condition and was extremely well maintained.   

THE GOOD:

-Termignoni full Titanium exhaust
-Ohlins steering damper 
-Cycle Cat upper triple clamp 
-Cycle Cat rearsets
-BMC air filter 
-Harris upper/front fairing stay
-Motovation frame and rear axle sliders
-Rizoma brake fluid reservoirs 
-Carbon fiber exhaust shields
-SS brake lines
-LOW MILEAGE
-free set of tires.  Bridgestone BT002's

THE BAD:
-the only negative with this bike is it was lowsided at Thunderhill in turn 11.  It has a dent in the gas tank as a result, and some wear on the left side frame slider and air duct.  please see pics.  only cosmetic damage.


No lowballers.  No test rides without cash in hand and a valid M1.

Up for sale is my '07 R1 sport bike. It has been regularly maintained with synthetic Mobil 1 racing 4T motor oil only. This bike has <15k on the clock.

It has some aftermarket features, including custom fairings, custom rear sets, and a few other things. This bike is street legal, with current registration till May, 2019. I'm motivated to sell, so will consider any REASONABLE offer. For a quick sale I'm asking $5000 or best offer. Test ride with collateral (cash or otherwise) and a valid M1 class license only.

I am selling a 2006 Yamaha R1 with 5031 miles.  It used to be a dedicated track bike, which is why it has such low mileage.

This bike is in near immaculate condition and was extremely well maintained.   

THE GOOD:

-Termignoni full Titanium exhaust
-Ohlins steering damper 
-Cycle Cat upper triple clamp 
-Cycle Cat rearsets
-BMC air filter 
-Harris upper/front fairing stay
-Motovation frame and rear axle sliders
-Rizoma brake fluid reservoirs 
-Carbon fiber exhaust shields
-SS brake lines
-LOW MILEAGE
-free set of tires.  Bridgestone BT002's

★★ '05 YAMAHA R1 RAVEN <10K MILES ★★

$3500

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Yamaha YZF-R1 with 9870 miles in great running condition. Bike was laid over on its left side but the left frame slider took the brunt of the fall. It was assessed by Moroney's Cycle of New Windsor, NY and was reported to be left with only cosmetic damage. The damage cost was quoted to be more than the book value of the bike so even though the title is still clean, I will be selling it with the damage disclosure statement checked off on the back of the title, which will render it "rebuilt" once it is registered in the buyer's name. I can provide a copy of the damage estimate to those seriously interested. The bike will pass inspection and ride perfectly. As it sits, it would make the perfect track bike but with new fairings and a tank, it could be a great road bike again too. It could also use a new shifter and left mirror. The engine casing is slightly filed down as well as the swingarm but nothing serious, no cracks. The bike comes with a Scorpion exhaust and a rear tire with low miles on it, as well as a brand new front tire (both Michelin Pilot Power II). Oil changed every 2,000 miles with Mobil 1 full synthetic, ran only 93 octane. Also an anodized gas cap was fitted on the bike so it comes with the OEM cap too. The bike does not come with the stands. 

Very quick machine, technically the lightest of all the R1 generations and very noticeable. Potentially an awesome deal for the right person. 

If serious about the bike, please look at the photos carefully and ask me any questions you might have. NO TRADES will be entertained, CASH ONLY. Thank you!

Finally letting go of my favorite bike of all time.  This is a 2003 Yamaha R1 with Ohlins front suspension, FULL Akrapovic titanium exhaust, power commander, steering stabilizer, and only 14,000 miles.  I'm an older guy and 2nd owner - this bike has never been down, raced, abused, stunted, etc.  It's in excellent condition.  Spark Plugs just replaced (this over $200), good tires (Michelin Power Pilot) ready to roll. Front fairing is not the original - it cracked right at the mirror but I still have it so you can see the bike was not laid down.

2002 Yamaha R1 with 16k original miles. Excellent condition never wrecked or down. This is my baby and it has been meticulously maintained. It runs and rides like a new bike. It has like new Michelin Pilot tires, FMF exhaust, frame sliders, rear cowl + seat, and integrated brake light and turn signals. It also comes with 2 other exhausts and a tank bag. Oil changed 400 miles ago. This bike needs nothing but a rider. No trades and no rides without cash in hand. I'm only selling it because I need the room and ride my Harley more.

Up for sale is a 2004 Yamaha YZF R1. This color was only produced for 2004 and is very rare. There are a couple modifications including a Power Commander V, Velocity Stacks, and a Race Exhaust modifications with a gutted Cat, Shorty Levers. The Bike runs and sounds fantastic. Transmission shifts smooth and the clutch grabs great. The bike is currently right around 12K Miles. At 10K Miles, the original Motor spun a rod bearing, was rebuilt, and then the timing chain popped causing it drop a valve. So a new motor was purchased. I was told it had 5K miles on the motor. It was put in and has been running like a top ever since. The bike will come with the other motor for donor parts it ever needs it. Please call or text me with any questions. I do not have to sell the bike, but I just don't ride it enough. No Crazy Low Offers, I will not even reply to them. $4100 OBO. Rode this bike yesterday 9/9/18 and it is running strong. Grab this thing up while the weather is as good as it is. 7K MILE ON MOTOR! Not looking for Trades at the moment and once again, I don't need to sell it, just don't ride it enough.

Up for sale is a 2004 Yamaha YZF R1. This color was only produced for 2004 and is very rare. There are a couple modifications including a Power Commander V, Velocity Stacks, and a Race Exhaust modifications with a gutted Cat, Shorty Levers. The Bike runs and sounds fantastic. Transmission shifts smooth and the clutch grabs great. The bike is currently right around 12K Miles. At 10K Miles, the original Motor spun a rod bearing, was rebuilt, and then the timing chain popped causing it drop a valve. So a new motor was purchased. I was told it had 5K miles on the motor. It was put in and has been running like a top ever since. The bike will come with the other motor for donor parts it ever needs it. Please call or text me with any questions. I do not have to sell the bike, but I just don't ride it enough. No Crazy Low Offers, I will not even reply to them. $4100 OBO. Rode this bike yesterday 9/9/18 and it is running strong. Grab this thing up while the weather is as good as it is. 7K MILE ON MOTOR! Not looking for Trades at the moment and once again, I don't need to sell it, just don't ride it enough.

Thanks,
Kirk

★★ '05 YAMAHA R1 RAVEN <10K MILES ★★

$3500

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Yamaha YZF-R1 with 9870 miles in great running condition. Bike was laid over on its left side but the left frame slider took the brunt of the fall. It was assessed by Moroney's Cycle of New Windsor, NY and was reported to be left with only cosmetic damage. The damage cost was quoted to be more than the book value of the bike so even though the title is still clean, I will be selling it with the damage disclosure statement checked off on the back of the title, which will render it "rebuilt" once it is registered in the buyer's name. I can provide a copy of the damage estimate to those seriously interested. The bike will pass inspection and ride perfectly. As it sits, it would make the perfect track bike but with new fairings and a tank, it could be a great road bike again too. It could also use a new shifter and left mirror. The engine casing is slightly filed down as well as the swingarm but nothing serious, no cracks. The bike comes with a Scorpion exhaust and a rear tire with low miles on it, as well as a brand new front tire (both Michelin Pilot Power II). Oil changed every 2,000 miles with Mobil 1 full synthetic, ran only 93 octane. Also an anodized gas cap was fitted on the bike so it comes with the OEM cap too. The bike does not come with the stands. 

Very quick machine, technically the lightest of all the R1 generations and very noticeable. Potentially an awesome deal for the right person. 

If serious about the bike, please look at the photos carefully and ask me any questions you might have. NO TRADES will be entertained, CASH ONLY. Thank you!

Up for sale is a 2004 Yamaha YZF R1. This color was only produced for 2004 and is very rare. There are a couple modifications including a Power Commander V, Velocity Stacks, and a Race Exhaust modifications with a gutted Cat, Shorty Levers. The Bike runs and sounds fantastic. Transmission shifts smooth and the clutch grabs great. The bike is currently right around 12K Miles. At 10K Miles, the original Motor spun a rod bearing, was rebuilt, and then the timing chain popped causing it drop a valve. So a new motor was purchased. I was told it had 5K miles on the motor. It was put in and has been running like a top ever since. The bike will come with the other motor for donor parts it ever needs it. Please call or text me with any questions. I do not have to sell the bike, but I just don't ride it enough. No Crazy Low Offers, I will not even reply to them. $4100 OBO. Rode this bike yesterday 9/9/18 and it is running strong. Grab this thing up while the weather is as good as it is. 7K MILE ON MOTOR! Not looking for Trades at the moment and once again, I don't need to sell it, just don't ride it enough.

Up for sale is my '07 R1 sport bike. It has been regularly maintained with synthetic Mobil 1 racing 4T motor oil only. This bike has <15k on the clock. The fork suspension has just been serviced, with new seals, boots, and oil. The gearing has been changed from OEM to a "power up" configuration, shifting the power band to a more effective, user-friendly (and much more fun) range. This bike has a wet weight of 480 lbs, and has 156 base horsepower. It has Michelin Pilot Power 2CT tires (my favorite for this kind of bike) with plenty of meat left on em. It has some aftermarket features, including custom fairings, custom rear sets, and a few other things. This bike is street legal, with current registration till May, 2019. I'm motivated to sell, so will consider any REASONABLE offer. For a quick sale I'm asking $5000 or best offer. Test ride with collateral (cash or otherwise) and a valid M1 class license only.

2006 Yamaha R1 with 5,031 miles -$5000- Clean with lots of goodies

$5000

QR Code Link to This Post


I am selling a 2006 Yamaha R1 with 5031 miles.  It used to be a dedicated track bike, which is why it has such low mileage.  It has a clean title and is Non-OP'd, so it can easily be converted back to a street bike if wanted.  The bike comes with an extra, brand new set of Bridgestone BT002's.  This bike is in near immaculate condition and was extremely well maintained.   

THE GOOD:

-Termignoni full Titanium exhaust
-Ohlins steering damper 
-Cycle Cat upper triple clamp 
-Cycle Cat rearsets
-BMC air filter 
-Harris upper/front fairing stay
-Motovation frame and rear axle sliders
-Rizoma brake fluid reservoirs 
-Carbon fiber exhaust shields
-SS brake lines
-LOW MILEAGE
-free set of tires.  Bridgestone BT002's

THE BAD:
-the only negative with this bike is it was lowsided at Thunderhill in turn 11.  It has a dent in the gas tank as a result, and some wear on the left side frame slider and air duct.  please see pics.  only cosmetic damage.


No lowballers.  No test rides without cash in hand and a valid M1.

★★ '05 YAMAHA R1 RAVEN <10K MILES ★★

$3500

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Yamaha YZF-R1 with 9870 miles in great running condition. Bike was laid over on its left side but the left frame slider took the brunt of the fall. It was assessed by Moroney's Cycle of New Windsor, NY and was reported to be left with only cosmetic damage. The damage cost was quoted to be more than the book value of the bike so even though the title is still clean, I will be selling it with the damage disclosure statement checked off on the back of the title, which will render it "rebuilt" once it is registered in the buyer's name. I can provide a copy of the damage estimate to those seriously interested. The bike will pass inspection and ride perfectly. As it sits, it would make the perfect track bike but with new fairings and a tank, it could be a great road bike again too. It could also use a new shifter and left mirror. The engine casing is slightly filed down as well as the swingarm but nothing serious, no cracks. The bike comes with a Scorpion exhaust and a rear tire with low miles on it, as well as a brand new front tire (both Michelin Pilot Power II). Oil changed every 2,000 miles with Mobil 1 full synthetic, ran only 93 octane. Also an anodized gas cap was fitted on the bike so it comes with the OEM cap too. The bike does not come with the stands. 

Very quick machine, technically the lightest of all the R1 generations and very noticeable. Potentially an awesome deal for the right person. 

If serious about the bike, please look at the photos carefully and ask me any questions you might have. NO TRADES will be entertained, CASH ONLY. Thank you!

★★ '05 YAMAHA R1 RAVEN <10K MILES ★★

$3500

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Yamaha YZF-R1 with 9870 miles in great running condition. Bike was laid over on its left side but the left frame slider took the brunt of the fall. It was assessed by Moroney's Cycle of New Windsor, NY and was reported to be left with only cosmetic damage. The damage cost was quoted to be more than the book value of the bike so even though the title is still clean, I will be selling it with the damage disclosure statement checked off on the back of the title, which will render it "rebuilt" once it is registered in the buyer's name. I can provide a copy of the damage estimate to those seriously interested. The bike will pass inspection and ride perfectly. As it sits, it would make the perfect track bike but with new fairings and a tank, it could be a great road bike again too. It could also use a new shifter and left mirror. The engine casing is slightly filed down as well as the swingarm but nothing serious, no cracks. The bike comes with a Scorpion exhaust and a rear tire with low miles on it, as well as a brand new front tire (both Michelin Pilot Power II). Oil changed every 2,000 miles with Mobil 1 full synthetic, ran only 93 octane. Also an anodized gas cap was fitted on the bike so it comes with the OEM cap too. The bike does not come with the stands. 

Very quick machine, technically the lightest of all the R1 generations and very noticeable. Potentially an awesome deal for the right person. 

If serious about the bike, please look at the photos carefully and ask me any questions you might have. NO TRADES will be entertained, CASH ONLY. Thank you!

If your fingers slip off of the clutch lever, you will fall of the bike and it will be cruising down the road. DO NOT OFFER ME 3000$ AND YOUR LIL GROM, I DONT WANT IT. 2003+ at least 1000cc.
Will consider all Hayabusas. Any questions just shoot me a message.

Oil changed 400 miles ago. This bike needs nothing but a rider. No trades and no rides without cash in hand. I'm only selling it because I need the room and ride my Harley more.

Finally letting go of my favorite bike of all time.  This is a 2003 Yamaha R1 with Ohlins front suspension, FULL Akrapovic titanium exhaust, power commander, steering stabilizer, and only 14,000 miles.  I'm an older guy and 2nd owner - this bike has never been down, raced, abused, stunted, etc.  It's in excellent condition.  Spark Plugs just replaced (this over $200), good tires (Michelin Power Pilot) ready to roll. Front fairing is not the original - it cracked right at the mirror but I still have it so you can see the bike was not laid down.

Cleanest R1 in the area. Brand new rear tire, fresh oil change, clean sprockets and chain, sliders, aftermarket throttle break and clutch levers. Voodoo Exhaust. 100% Unmolested. I am the second owner and have put less than 150 miles on the bike. There is not a single scratch on this bike. I will consider trading, the only reason for sale is because my heart is set on a Hayabusa. I'm at that stage in my life where it's like go hard or go home. This is not a beginners bike. If your fingers slip off of the clutch lever, you will fall of the bike and it will be cruising down the road. DO NOT OFFER ME 3000$ AND YOUR LIL GROM, I DONT WANT IT. 2003+ at least 1000cc.
Will consider all Hayabusas. Any questions just shoot me a message.
