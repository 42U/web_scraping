This bike doesn't need much discription.  If you're looking for one of these then you know what they are. An all day mile destroyer on pavement or dirt roads. I've takin this bike all over the country and it has never let me down. It's ready to keep going. It has enough luggage space for you and your significant other for a week. My wife and I have done that several times.  Here's what it has. 

-Happy trail aluminum paneers, with locks and hooks on top to strap down additional luggage. 
-Givi top case with lock 
-Rox multi direction bar risers 
-Black widow exhaust (British company) with removable silencer. Sounds awesome especially with the next item 

-Power Commander V for tuning and quickshifter. The quickshiter is activated by what used to be the flash to pass trigger. Just put a little pressure on the gear shifter and hit the trigger and BOOM, you're in the next gear. No clutch needed. You can shift wide open throttle without the clutch like a track bike. It is AWESOME! It's activated at 2000 rpm. It cuts spark for a split second so it takes the load off the transmission. 

-K&N air filter 
-heated grips 
-crash bars
-aluminum bash plate for underneath protection 
-center stand 
-sergeant seat 
-wilbers rear shock 
-michelin anakee 3 tires. Maybe 70% tread left? They're good tires. (Wet in pic not armorall) 
-chain and sprockets relatively new. Lots of life left in them. 
-pig tail coming off battery for electrical accessories, battery tender etc. 

Condition. 
This bike has been ridden. It is not a garage queen. It has 51k miles but is strong and fast as ever. I'd ride across the country right now without thinking twice about it. It doesn't leak a drop of anything. Overall condition of the plastics is good for its age. There's a little boo-boo on the front left fairing but like I said, no trailer or garage queen here. It has a face only a mother can love like most adventure bikes. This bike is loaded with everything you want and you'll save thousands on not having to buy all the gear you need/want to have a serious touring adventure motorcycle.  Please call or text. If I don't answer then leave me a voicemail or text and I'll get back to you. 2o5-223-six 8 six 2

Great bike that needs nothing.  Recent valve adjustment and new belts, termignoni exhaust, and Barnett clutch.  The ds series is the most reliable engine Ducati made.  The 2 valve air cooled engine pumps out 92 hp and tons of torque.  I have the owners manual, two regular keys, and the red program key.

This is the practical alternative solution to a supermoto.

2003 Suzuki TL100R that is unique in its own way. Best of both worlds between a sports bike and a v-twin. The unique sound always turns heads.

This is my 2nd TLR. Purchased it a few years ago and have ridden it around TN,GA, AL, NC and SC. I have a cruiser too and just do not ride this that often. I have added  HealTech FI Turner Pro and Gear Indicator with TRE, Eastern Beaver Headlight Relay mod, updated the common issue with the ground and rectifier, added a headlight bypass switch with USB and 12v cig charger, and K&N Air Filter. The exhaust is from a TLS and the internals modified for better sound. Bike has been ridden so normal scuffs on paint.  No rides unless cash in hand, you drop or damage, it is your bike.

Two common things are going on with this bike.
1. Stator needs to be replaced. Battery will not stay charged if riding at night or with headlight on during the day in stop and go traffic. On the hwy you are good.
2. The left fork seal is leaking.

Finally letting go of my favorite bike of all time.  This is a 2003 Yamaha R1 with Ohlins front suspension, FULL Akrapovic titanium exhaust, power commander, steering stabilizer, and only 14,000 miles.  I'm an older guy and 2nd owner - this bike has never been down, raced, abused, stunted, etc.  It's in excellent condition.  Spark Plugs just replaced (this over $200), good tires (Michelin Power Pilot) ready to roll. Front fairing is not the original - it cracked right at the mirror but I still have it so you can see the bike was not laid down.

This bike doesn't need much discription.  If you're looking for one of these then you know what they are. An all day mile destroyer on pavement or dirt roads. I've takin this bike all over the country and it has never let me down. It's ready to keep going. It has enough luggage space for you and your significant other for a week. My wife and I have done that several times.  Here's what it has. 

-Happy trail aluminum paneers, with locks and hooks on top to strap down additional luggage. 
-Givi top case with lock 
-Rox multi direction bar risers 
-Black widow exhaust (British company) with removable silencer. Sounds awesome especially with the next item 

-Power Commander V for tuning and quickshifter. The quickshiter is activated by what used to be the flash to pass trigger. Just put a little pressure on the gear shifter and hit the trigger and BOOM, you're in the next gear. No clutch needed. You can shift wide open throttle without the clutch like a track bike. It is AWESOME! It's activated at 2000 rpm. It cuts spark for a split second so it takes the load off the transmission. 

-K&N air filter 
-heated grips 
-crash bars
-aluminum bash plate for underneath protection 
-center stand 
-sergeant seat 
-wilbers rear shock 
-michelin anakee 3 tires. Maybe 70% tread left? They're good tires. (Wet in pic not armorall) 
-chain and sprockets relatively new. Lots of life left in them. 
-pig tail coming off battery for electrical accessories, battery tender etc. 

Condition. 
This bike has been ridden. It is not a garage queen. It has 51k miles but is strong and fast as ever. I'd ride across the country right now without thinking twice about it. It doesn't leak a drop of anything. Overall condition of the plastics is good for its age. There's a little boo-boo on the front left fairing but like I said, no trailer or garage queen here. It has a face only a mother can love like most adventure bikes. This bike is loaded with everything you want and you'll save thousands on not having to buy all the gear you need/want to have a serious touring adventure motorcycle.  Please call or text. If I don't answer then leave me a voicemail or text and I'll get back to you. 2o5-223-six 8 six 2

This bike doesn't need much discription.  If you're looking for one of these then you know what they are. An all day mile destroyer on pavement or dirt roads. I've takin this bike all over the country and it has never let me down. It's ready to keep going. It has enough luggage space for you and your significant other for a week. My wife and I have done that several times.  Here's what it has. 

-Happy trail aluminum paneers, with locks and hooks on top to strap down additional luggage. 
-Givi top case with lock 
-Rox multi direction bar risers 
-Black widow exhaust (British company) with removable silencer. Sounds awesome especially with the next item 

-Power Commander V for tuning and quickshifter. The quickshiter is activated by what used to be the flash to pass trigger. Just put a little pressure on the gear shifter and hit the trigger and BOOM, you're in the next gear. No clutch needed. You can shift wide open throttle without the clutch like a track bike. It is AWESOME! It's activated at 2000 rpm. It cuts spark for a split second so it takes the load off the transmission. 

-K&N air filter 
-heated grips 
-crash bars
-aluminum bash plate for underneath protection 
-center stand 
-sergeant seat 
-wilbers rear shock 
-michelin anakee 3 tires. Maybe 70% tread left? They're good tires. (Wet in pic not armorall) 
-chain and sprockets relatively new. Lots of life left in them. 
-pig tail coming off battery for electrical accessories, battery tender etc. 

Condition. 
This bike has been ridden. It is not a garage queen. It has 51k miles but is strong and fast as ever. I'd ride across the country right now without thinking twice about it. It doesn't leak a drop of anything. Overall condition of the plastics is good for its age. There's a little boo-boo on the front left fairing but like I said, no trailer or garage queen here.

Up for sale is a pristine Yamaha FZ1. This bike is a 100% Garage kept bike, the only time it has seen water is when it was being washed. I am the 2nd owner of this bike, and trust me this is a pampered bike. I have put about 1000 miles in the last 2 years on the bike that is why I am selling it (I really don't want to). It has 16K miles on it, all interstate. This bike has been ridden by mature adults and maintained properly.

The bike has the original tool set that it comes with. The tires have less than 1000 miles on them, they are Bridgestone Battel Ax Duel compound tires. The bike is wired for a battery tender so you can simply plug it in to keep the battery charged. Clear title in hand. This bike is a steal with all the upgrades, NADA list the stock value at $4765. I am will to accept Bitcoin as payment 

The Bike has many upgrades:
Corbin Gel seat ($450) http://www.corbin.com/
Fender eliminator kit with LED brake light with build in turn signal ($250)
Ivan Fuel-Cut Eliminator ($225) www.IvansPerformanceProducts.com
Nelson-Rigg Saddle Bags ($150) https://www.nelsonrigg.com/ 
Battery tender ($30)
Factory Half Tank Cover ($45)
Tall Windshield.($40)
The bike has many small cosmetic upgrades to go along with the Golden/Red Paint like levers, pegs, Bolts etc... (The "Iron Man Bike" as my niece calls it)

Other Extras.
Original Bike owners.
Full Factory manual 
1 Oil Filter
4 Quarts of Oil
4 NGK Spark Plugs 

NO JOY RIDES. If you intend to test ride the bike bring cash in hand which I will hold as collateral, otherwise you can't ride it. 
Please don't low ball me, because I am in no need or rush to sell this bike.  
I don't need help selling this bike.
NO Trades!
Scammers, do us all a favor and go jump of a building.

For Sale or trade for standard transmission Mini Cooper.  Great running and riding bike.  Looking at selling due to my job move downtown and will not have the time I would like to have to ride. 
The exhaust was replaced to make for a louder sound to be seen and heard on the roads.  Along with the exhaust I have added a power commander to complement the bike's engine and exhaust; she's growls nicely.
stock exhaust comes with the bike.

Bike is in excellent condition and has been in storage for several years now. It only has 14k original miles and I have a clean title in hand. The bike runs perfect and is ready to ride with brand new tires and new battery. Must sell as I've emptied out my storage unit and have no space for it in my garage. If you're looking for a lightly used, garage kept, adult ridden motorcycle this is it.

This bike doesn't need much discription.  If you're looking for one of these then you know what they are. An all day mile destroyer on pavement or dirt roads. I've takin this bike all over the country and it has never let me down. It's ready to keep going. It has enough luggage space for you and your significant other for a week. My wife and I have done that several times.  Here's what it has. 

-Happy trail aluminum paneers, with locks and hooks on top to strap down additional luggage. 
-Givi top case with lock 
-Rox multi direction bar risers 
-Black widow exhaust (British company) with removable silencer. Sounds awesome especially with the next item 

-Power Commander V for tuning and quickshifter. The quickshiter is activated by what used to be the flash to pass trigger. Just put a little pressure on the gear shifter and hit the trigger and BOOM, you're in the next gear. No clutch needed. You can shift wide open throttle without the clutch like a track bike. It is AWESOME! It's activated at 2000 rpm. It cuts spark for a split second so it takes the load off the transmission. 

-K&N air filter 
-heated grips 
-crash bars
-aluminum bash plate for underneath protection 
-center stand 
-sergeant seat 
-wilbers rear shock 
-michelin anakee 3 tires. Maybe 70% tread left? They're good tires. (Wet in pic not armorall) 
-chain and sprockets relatively new. Lots of life left in them. 
-pig tail coming off battery for electrical accessories, battery tender etc. 

Condition. 
This bike has been ridden. It is not a garage queen. It has 51k miles but is strong and fast as ever. I'd ride across the country right now without thinking twice about it. It doesn't leak a drop of anything. Overall condition of the plastics is good for its age. There's a little boo-boo on the front left fairing but like I said, no trailer or garage queen here. It has a face only a mother can love like most adventure bikes. This bike is loaded with everything you want and you'll save thousands on not having to buy all the gear you need/want to have a serious touring adventure motorcycle.  Please call or text. If I don't answer then leave me a voicemail or text and I'll get back to you. 2o5-223-six 8 six 2

This is a mechanic special!
2002 Suzuki V-Strom DL1000 that I purchased in 2007 with 13,637 miles.  Current mileage is approximately 17,500.  The display works but with the fuel pump removed it will not display odometer reading.  Tires have about 900 miles on them.  Bike has been garage kept.  Fuel tank was removed because of bad fuel and I never got back to repairing it/putting it back together and I am selling as is.  The blue tape on fuel tank is protecting the original paint as I repainted the rest of the tank.  Tank has been resealed and bike may need a new fuel pump.  To my knowledge, all removed parts/hardware have been saved and will be provided to new owner.  Before fuel contamination the bike road great and everything worked perfectly.  Previous owner did lay it down on left side and caused cosmetic damage only.  Scratches on the left fairing can be seen in the pictures.  Not pictured are two Suzuki hard bags, one for each side.  It has been sitting for approximately 5 years.  Title is clear, in hand, and not a salvage title.  Cash only sale and buyer must pick up.  Located in E. Brainerd, Chattanooga TN.  Please ask any questions.  $2,000 OBO

Great bike that needs nothing.  Recent valve adjustment and new belts, termignoni exhaust, and Barnett clutch.  The ds series is the most reliable engine Ducati made.  The 2 valve air cooled engine pumps out 92 hp and tons of torque.  I have the owners manual, two regular keys, and the red program key.

2003 Suzuki TL100R that is unique in its own way. Best of both worlds between a sports bike and a v-twin. The unique sound always turns heads.

This is my 2nd TLR. Purchased it a few years ago and have ridden it around TN,GA, AL, NC and SC. I have a cruiser too and just do not ride this that often. I have added  HealTech FI Turner Pro and Gear Indicator with TRE, Eastern Beaver Headlight Relay mod, updated the common issue with the ground and rectifier, added a headlight bypass switch with USB and 12v cig charger, and K&N Air Filter. The exhaust is from a TLS and the internals modified for better sound. Bike has been ridden so normal scuffs on paint.  No rides unless cash in hand, you drop or damage, it is your bike.

Two common things are going on with this bike.
1. Stator needs to be replaced. Battery will not stay charged if riding at night or with headlight on during the day in stop and go traffic. On the hwy you are good.
2. The left fork seal is leaking.

Finally letting go of my favorite bike of all time.  This is a 2003 Yamaha R1 with Ohlins front suspension, FULL Akrapovic titanium exhaust, power commander, steering stabilizer, and only 14,000 miles.  I'm an older guy and 2nd owner - this bike has never been down, raced, abused, stunted, etc.  It's in excellent condition.  Spark Plugs just replaced (this over $200), good tires (Michelin Power Pilot) ready to roll. Front fairing is not the original - it cracked right at the mirror but I still have it so you can see the bike was not laid down.

This is a mechanic special!
2002 Suzuki V-Strom DL1000 that I purchased in 2007 with 13,637 miles.  Current mileage is approximately 17,500.  The display works but with the fuel pump removed it will not display odometer reading.  Tires have about 900 miles on them.  Bike has been garage kept.  Fuel tank was removed because of bad fuel and I never got back to repairing it/putting it back together and I am selling as is.  The blue tape on fuel tank is protecting the original paint as I repainted the rest of the tank.  Tank has been resealed and bike may need a new fuel pump.  To my knowledge, all removed parts/hardware have been saved and will be provided to new owner.  Before fuel contamination the bike road great and everything worked perfectly.  Previous owner did lay it down on left side and caused cosmetic damage only.  Scratches on the left fairing can be seen in the pictures.  Not pictured are two Suzuki hard bags, one for each side.  It has been sitting for approximately 5 years.  Title is clear, in hand, and not a salvage title.  Cash only sale and buyer must pick up.  Located in E. Brainerd, Chattanooga TN.  Please ask any questions.  $2,000 OBO

This bike doesn't need much discription.  If you're looking for one of these then you know what they are. An all day mile destroyer on pavement or dirt roads. I've takin this bike all over the country and it has never let me down. It's ready to keep going. It has enough luggage space for you and your significant other for a week. My wife and I have done that several times.  Here's what it has. 

-Happy trail aluminum paneers, with locks and hooks on top to strap down additional luggage. 
-Givi top case with lock 
-Rox multi direction bar risers 
-Black widow exhaust (British company) with removable silencer. Sounds awesome especially with the next item 

-Power Commander V for tuning and quickshifter. The quickshiter is activated by what used to be the flash to pass trigger. Just put a little pressure on the gear shifter and hit the trigger and BOOM, you're in the next gear. No clutch needed. You can shift wide open throttle without the clutch like a track bike. It is AWESOME! It's activated at 2000 rpm. It cuts spark for a split second so it takes the load off the transmission. 

-K&N air filter 
-heated grips 
-crash bars
-aluminum bash plate for underneath protection 
-center stand 
-sergeant seat 
-wilbers rear shock 
-michelin anakee 3 tires. Maybe 70% tread left? They're good tires. (Wet in pic not armorall) 
-chain and sprockets relatively new. Lots of life left in them. 
-pig tail coming off battery for electrical accessories, battery tender etc. 

Condition. 
This bike has been ridden. It is not a garage queen. It has 51k miles but is strong and fast as ever. I'd ride across the country right now without thinking twice about it. It doesn't leak a drop of anything. Overall condition of the plastics is good for its age. There's a little boo-boo on the front left fairing but like I said, no trailer or garage queen here. It has a face only a mother can love like most adventure bikes. This bike is loaded with everything you want and you'll save thousands on not having to buy all the gear you need/want to have a serious touring adventure motorcycle.  Please call or text. If I don't answer then leave me a voicemail or text and I'll get back to you. 2o5-223-six 8 six 2

Bike's in great shape. Fires right up, no smoke, no mechanical issues. I'm the second owner, had it since 2010. Maintenance has been kept up. It was laid down once hence the aftermarket body but no structural damage occurred. It has K&N air filter, Two Brothers bolt-ons, and PCIII. Front brakes have been upgraded to Nissin calipers from a Zx14, braided lines, and a Brembo front caliper. Also has a white LED light kit. Clean title in hand. Located in Waveland. I'm not interested in trades.

This bike doesn't need much discription.  If you're looking for one of these then you know what they are. An all day mile destroyer on pavement or dirt roads. I've takin this bike all over the country and it has never let me down. It's ready to keep going. It has enough luggage space for you and your significant other for a week. My wife and I have done that several times.  Here's what it has. 

-Happy trail aluminum paneers, with locks and hooks on top to strap down additional luggage. 
-Givi top case with lock 
-Rox multi direction bar risers 
-Black widow exhaust (British company) with removable silencer. Sounds awesome especially with the next item 

-Power Commander V for tuning and quickshifter. The quickshiter is activated by what used to be the flash to pass trigger. Just put a little pressure on the gear shifter and hit the trigger and BOOM, you're in the next gear. No clutch needed. You can shift wide open throttle without the clutch like a track bike. It is AWESOME! It's activated at 2000 rpm. It cuts spark for a split second so it takes the load off the transmission. 

-K&N air filter 
-heated grips 
-crash bars
-aluminum bash plate for underneath protection 
-center stand 
-sergeant seat 
-wilbers rear shock 
-michelin anakee 3 tires. Maybe 70% tread left? They're good tires. (Wet in pic not armorall) 
-chain and sprockets relatively new. Lots of life left in them. 
-pig tail coming off battery for electrical accessories, battery tender etc. 

Condition. 
This bike has been ridden. It is not a garage queen. It has 51k miles but is strong and fast as ever. I'd ride across the country right now without thinking twice about it. It doesn't leak a drop of anything. Overall condition of the plastics is good for its age. There's a little boo-boo on the front left fairing but like I said, no trailer or garage queen here. It has a face only a mother can love like most adventure bikes. This bike is loaded with everything you want and you'll save thousands on not having to buy all the gear you need/want to have a serious touring adventure motorcycle.  Please call or text. If I don't answer then leave me a voicemail or text and I'll get back to you. 2o5-223-six 8 six 2

Hi, I'm selling my 2014 Yamaha FZ1. This is a very nice and fast bike! I bought it a few months ago, it has a little over 20,600 miles on it, ( had 19,900 when I bought it) and a few upgrades. I installed a Coffman shorty muffler on it, new handle bar end mirrors and a zero gravity windshield. There is a little bit of damage on the right side plastics. but nothing serious! The previous owner said it happened in storage but I'm pretty sure it got dropped, This is a great bike but I've decided I want something different. If you'd like any more info or would like to come look at it give me a call, shoot me a text, or e-mail me, thank you.

Hi, I'm selling my 2014 Yamaha FZ1. This is a very nice and fast bike! I bought it a few months ago, it has a little over 20,600 miles on it, ( had 19,900 when I bought it) and a few upgrades. I installed a Coffman shorty muffler on it, new handle bar end mirrors and a zero gravity windshield. There is a little bit of damage on the right side plastics. but nothing serious! The previous owner said it happened in storage but I'm pretty sure it got dropped, This is a great bike but I've decided I want something different. If you'd like any more info or would like to come look at it give me a call, shoot me a text, or e-mail me, thank you.

'04 1000rr. 20k Miles, runs excellent. I had an unpainted set of fairings so I painted them, It's not professionally done so there are some blemishes. The previous owner lowsided it on the right side and I have low sided it on the left. Not really any damage to the bike other than a scrape on the case and frame. 

Here are the new parts I've put on it, 
-Frame sliders
-Black shorty Levers
-Integrated lights in mirrors
-Side indicators
-New Brake light
-Fork Seals repaired less than 2000 miles ago
-Just changed oil and fluids
-Brake pads are still good
-I also have a new chain and sprocket kit that I haven't had the chance to put on yet

Now for the bad,
-The '04 1000rr has a speedometer recall where the speedo reads 75% of what you're actually driving 
-Needs a new set of tires
-Lowbeam bulb just burned out
-Minor scrapes and scuffs from low side
-My slip on muffler was stolen

As I continue to own the bike, the light bulb and tires will be replaced and the price will go up. 

This bike is not for beginners, no test ride without a M liscence and cash in hand. Everything else is totally functional and in working order. It is my daily driver as of right now. I will not entertain lowball offers. If you have any further questions, just send me a text. Clean title. Thanks

The mirrors were wrapped and are now degrading, also the previous owner. Only problems are a manual switch for the head lights and the internal light for the cluster doesnt work. Bought the bike with both problems, worked around them. Not in a hurry to sell. Cash only. No trades. No rides without cash in hand. Dont low ball.

'04 1000rr. 20k Miles, runs excellent. I had an unpainted set of fairings so I painted them, It's not professionally done so there are some blemishes. The previous owner lowsided it on the right side and I have low sided it on the left. Not really any damage to the bike other than a scrape on the case and frame. 

Here are the new parts I've put on it, 
-Frame sliders
-Black shorty Levers
-Integrated lights in mirrors
-Side indicators
-New Brake light
-Fork Seals repaired less than 2000 miles ago
-Just changed oil and fluids
-Brake pads are still good
-I also have a new chain and sprocket kit that I haven't had the chance to put on yet

Now for the bad,
-The '04 1000rr has a speedometer recall where the speedo reads 75% of what you're actually driving 
-Needs a new set of tires
-Lowbeam bulb just burned out
-Minor scrapes and scuffs from low side
-My slip on muffler was stolen

As I continue to own the bike, the light bulb and tires will be replaced and the price will go up. 

This bike is not for beginners, no test ride without a M liscence and cash in hand. Everything else is totally functional and in working order. It is my daily driver as of right now. I will not entertain lowball offers. If you have any further questions, just send me a text. Clean title. Thanks

Will trade up or down for following items only or similar, vintage air cooled motocross bikes, two stroke street bike,  pre 72 enduro, Bimota, RZ 350, 80s Ducati, 1986 0r 1987 GSXR 750 or GSXR1100, Ducati 916, 851, 888, 996, 998, 748 Honda RC51, Husqvarna, Maico, Bultaco, CZ, RM370, RM250, RM125, Norton Commando, trials bike.

The mirrors were wrapped and are now degrading, also the previous owner. Only problems are a manual switch for the head lights and the internal light for the cluster doesnt work. Bought the bike with both problems, worked around them. Not in a hurry to sell. Cash only. No trades. No rides without cash in hand. Dont low ball.

The mirrors were wrapped and are now degrading, also the previous owner. Only problems are a manual switch for the head lights and the internal light for the cluster doesnt work. Bought the bike with both problems, worked around them. Not in a hurry to sell. Cash only. No trades. No rides without cash in hand. Dont low ball.

'04 1000rr. 20k Miles, runs excellent. I had an unpainted set of fairings so I painted them, It's not professionally done so there are some blemishes. The previous owner lowsided it on the right side and I have low sided it on the left. Not really any damage to the bike other than a scrape on the case and frame. 

Here are the new parts I've put on it, 
-Frame sliders
-Black shorty Levers
-Integrated lights in mirrors
-Side indicators
-New Brake light
-Fork Seals repaired less than 2000 miles ago
-Just changed oil and fluids
-Brake pads are still good
-I also have a new chain and sprocket kit that I haven't had the chance to put on yet

Now for the bad,
-The '04 1000rr has a speedometer recall where the speedo reads 75% of what you're actually driving 
-Needs a new set of tires
-Lowbeam bulb just burned out
-Minor scrapes and scuffs from low side
-My slip on muffler was stolen

As I continue to own the bike, the light bulb and tires will be replaced and the price will go up. 

This bike is not for beginners, no test ride without a M liscence and cash in hand. Everything else is totally functional and in working order. It is my daily driver as of right now. I will not entertain lowball offers. If you have any further questions, just send me a text. Clean title. Thanks

Bike has been meticulously maintained with only synthetic fluids and never raced.  I took a 5mph spill taking a right turn from a stop light in the construction zone on Grant. Bike runs and rides perfect but will need a foot brake lever and right front turn signal.  Pics are attached of cosmetic damage.  Clean title. Soft bags available.  I will be back in Tucson this weekend, 12th-14th, to sell the bike. I have been offered $2000 by an acquaintance who wants to race it so will take the best offer over that by Sunday 5pm. Please text or leave a message with any questions.  Thanks.

2003 R1 with 21,000 miles. Very clean and garage kept. All stock and VERY fast. This bike is super light weight and very modestly ridden. I purchased it at 15,000 miles and it is impressive how new it looks. Passenger seat and seat eliminator cover. This bike low weight and powerful motor would do very well on a track. Selling it because of needed Jeep parts and it will get me in trouble. Needs a owner who will ride it how it was designed to be ridden. Picture do her no justice. Contact Jason at show contact info

The mirrors were wrapped and are now degrading, also the previous owner. Only problems are a manual switch for the head lights and the internal light for the cluster doesnt work. Bought the bike with both problems, worked around them. Not in a hurry to sell. Cash only. No trades. No rides without cash in hand. Dont low ball.

Bike has been meticulously maintained with only synthetic fluids and never raced.  I took a 5mph spill taking a right turn from a stop light in the construction zone on Grant. Bike runs and rides perfect but will need a foot brake lever and right front turn signal.  Pics are attached of cosmetic damage.  Clean title. Soft bags available.  I will be back in Tucson this weekend, 12th-14th, to sell the bike. I have been offered $2000 by an acquaintance who wants to race it so will take the best offer over that by Sunday 5pm.

The mirrors were wrapped and are now degrading, also the previous owner. Only problems are a manual switch for the head lights and the internal light for the cluster doesnt work. Bought the bike with both problems, worked around them. Not in a hurry to sell. Cash only. No trades. No rides without cash in hand. Dont low ball.

'04 1000rr. 20k Miles, runs excellent. I had an unpainted set of fairings so I painted them, It's not professionally done so there are some blemishes. The previous owner lowsided it on the right side and I have low sided it on the left. Not really any damage to the bike other than a scrape on the case and frame. 

Here are the new parts I've put on it, 
-Frame sliders
-Black shorty Levers
-Integrated lights in mirrors
-Side indicators
-New Brake light
-Fork Seals repaired less than 2000 miles ago
-Just changed oil and fluids
-Brake pads are still good
-I also have a new chain and sprocket kit that I haven't had the chance to put on yet

Now for the bad,
-The '04 1000rr has a speedometer recall where the speedo reads 75% of what you're actually driving 
-Needs a new set of tires
-Lowbeam bulb just burned out
-Minor scrapes and scuffs from low side
-My slip on muffler was stolen

As I continue to own the bike, the light bulb and tires will be replaced and the price will go up. 

This bike is not for beginners, no test ride without a M liscence and cash in hand. Everything else is totally functional and in working order. It is my daily driver as of right now. I will not entertain lowball offers. If you have any further questions, just send me a text. Clean title. Thanks

I purchased it at 15,000 miles and it is impressive how new it looks. Passenger seat and seat eliminator cover. This bike low weight and powerful motor would do very well on a track. Selling it because of needed Jeep parts and it will get me in trouble. Needs a owner who will ride it how it was designed to be ridden. Picture do her no justice. Contact Jason at show contact info

Also did a valve adjustment 1k miles ago. Most of the work was done 1k miles ago. Im selling it because ive got other priorities. Theres minor scratches on the tail from the previous owner. The mirrors were wrapped and are now degrading, also the previous owner. Only problems are a manual switch for the head lights and the internal light for the cluster doesnt work. Bought the bike with both problems, worked around them. Not in a hurry to sell. Cash only. No trades. No rides without cash in hand. Dont low ball.

Bike has been meticulously maintained with only synthetic fluids and never raced.  I took a 5mph spill taking a right turn from a stop light in the construction zone on Grant. Bike runs and rides perfect but will need a foot brake lever and right front turn signal.  Pics are attached of cosmetic damage.  Clean title. Soft bags available.  I will be back in Tucson this weekend, 12th-14th, to sell the bike. I have been offered $2000 by an acquaintance who wants to race it so will take the best offer over that by Sunday 5pm.

'04 1000rr. 20k Miles, runs excellent. I had an unpainted set of fairings so I painted them, It's not professionally done so there are some blemishes. The previous owner lowsided it on the right side and I have low sided it on the left. Not really any damage to the bike other than a scrape on the case and frame. 

Here are the new parts I've put on it, 
-Frame sliders
-Black shorty Levers
-Integrated lights in mirrors
-Side indicators
-New Brake light
-Fork Seals repaired less than 2000 miles ago
-Just changed oil and fluids
-Brake pads are still good
-I also have a new chain and sprocket kit that I haven't had the chance to put on yet

Now for the bad,
-The '04 1000rr has a speedometer recall where the speedo reads 75% of what you're actually driving 
-Needs a new set of tires
-Lowbeam bulb just burned out
-Minor scrapes and scuffs from low side
-My slip on muffler was stolen

As I continue to own the bike, the light bulb and tires will be replaced and the price will go up. 

This bike is not for beginners, no test ride without a M liscence and cash in hand. Everything else is totally functional and in working order. It is my daily driver as of right now. I will not entertain lowball offers. If you have any further questions, just send me a text. Clean title. Thanks

I'm selling my 2003 Yamaha FZ-1. It runs good and is very reliable and it's a very fast bike. It has the same engine as the R1 race bike, except Yamaha de-tuned it a bit so it's better for touring. It's one of the most comfortable bikes I've ever owned. I can't ride crotch rockets for very long so this is the next best thing. Great for long rides and it handles great. I'm only selling because I will be moving out of state in a few months and don't want to move it. It has several upgrades from the previous owner as well as some scratches on the side from when he went down at about 10mph. It doesn't effect the bike in any way other than looks. The engine has aftermarket crash guards so there is no engine damage, it just pushed the bars into the tank on one side and cracked the front fairing. I would be willing to trade or partial trade on a trailer for when I move, other than that cash only, and cash in my hand before you even think about riding it, sorry no exceptions, this bike is too fast. Call Tony at 847 nine eight seven 000 three

The upgrades on this bike alone were well over $1500. This has the extremely rare (impossible to find) multi-gauge that replaced the stock fuel gauge with an integrated display that tells, gear position, fuel, speed, temp, etc.

Aftermarket upgrades: 
Sargent Seat $300+  - Extremely more comfort for long rides
Penske Racing rear shock $500+ - fully adjustable
Engine guards $85
Multi-gauge display, was $500 installed - impossible to find, when you can, people still pay $300 for them
Yoshimura Pipe $400 - Sounds sweet
Pirelli Angel GT tires $300 - these are the absolute best tire for a sport-touring bike, I'll never use another tire.

Priced $1000 under KBB for quick sale.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll wait until Spring and relist at MSRP.  

Clean Title on Hand, Current Registration, Starts Right Up, Idles Perfect, Revs Perfect, Shifts Perfect, Original Suzuki Key, and can be ridden home or straight to the canyons~

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.  Learn about it here even if you don't want the bike! https://www.superstreetbike.com/gsx-r1000-in-full-power-mode-can-you-turn-1000-into-600-mythbusters

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Bring your pessimistic mechanic friend and lift her skirt, take her for a test ride, and bring your magnifying glass. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Thanks,
Jake

Hi CL, I'm selling my 2005 FZ1. Broke my leg badly (not riding) and required surgery. Can't ride for 6+ months, and I need the money to pay for the surgery. The bike has been 100% garage kept and responsibly ridden (daily) as a commuter bike. Clean title, registration through May 2019.

- Maintenance within last 3 weeks 
- New Michelin Pilot Road Sport 4 front tire ($140)
- Back tire same model, 70% tread left
New battery ($110)
Oil Change/Filter ($45)
Carb clean and Sync ($200)
Spark Plugs (4 x $5)
Chain Lube (Only half a tank ridden since)

- Specs -
Size: 998cc
Horsepower: 120
MPG: 40-45
Tank Size: 4 gallons
Rear tire: 180
Front tire: 120
weight: 458lb

- Upgrades - 
Shorty adjustable levers
Shortened Exhaust (Not obnoxiously loud, but a sexy loud)
Tinted windscreen
Turn signals (front + back)

The only thing the bike will need in the near future is a new chain (sprocket is ok). Bike starts and runs beautifully regardless of weather or sit time. I love this bike and don't want to sell it, so I want to make sure she goes to a good home. Open to partial trades but need the cash more than anything.

*CLEAN TITLE

Test ride with helmet, cash and M1 in hand.

For Sale: Suzuki DL1000 V-Strom

Was a daily but got a new job further away.  I will be moving so my baby has to find a new home. This is a very fun bike and commuting to work I always had a smile on my face.  I also used to ride to Orange county and back on the weekends which is where most of the miles came from.

The Good:
Givi windscreen with adjustable mount
New Battery
Throttle lock (this should be a must for every bike)
Just paid registration, just need sticker for 11/2019
Cheap/removable top case

The bad: 
1. Seat starting to crack and a large crack has developed on the right side.  I would recommend a more comfortable seat anyway, my regret is not buying one.
2. Dusty.   Needs a wash.  Pictures show current state except one from when it was clean.
3. Right side of topcase scratched up.  This is from when I used to park in a garage to make room to walk through.


No trades or tattoos or other offers. Cash only.  Prefer initial email communication.
I work out of town during the week so viewing will need to be on the weekends

'04 1000rr. 20k Miles, runs excellent. I had an unpainted set of fairings so I painted them, It's not professionally done so there are some blemishes. The previous owner lowsided it on the right side and I have low sided it on the left. Not really any damage to the bike other than a scrape on the case and frame. 

Here are the new parts I've put on it, 
-Frame sliders
-Black shorty Levers
-Integrated lights in mirrors
-Side indicators
-New Brake light
-Fork Seals repaired less than 2000 miles ago
-Just changed oil and fluids
-Brake pads are still good
-I also have a new chain and sprocket kit that I haven't had the chance to put on yet

Now for the bad,
-The '04 1000rr has a speedometer recall where the speedo reads 75% of what you're actually driving 
-Needs a new set of tires
-Lowbeam bulb just burned out
-Minor scrapes and scuffs from low side
-My slip on muffler was stolen

As I continue to own the bike, the light bulb and tires will be replaced and the price will go up. 

This bike is not for beginners, no test ride without a M liscence and cash in hand. Everything else is totally functional and in working order. It is my daily driver as of right now. I will not entertain lowball offers. If you have any further questions, just send me a text. Clean title. Thanks

Tires are in decent shape
No tears in the seat
Will pass inspection no problem.

Do not let the mileage fool you. Besides a few scratches and scuffs (which is to be expected with this age and mileage), it looks absolutely phenomenal and runs down the road flawlessly. Does not leak anything. 

Calls only! Will not respond to any texts. I have a clean title in my name. NO TRADES! Cash only! Serious inquires only!

2005 Kawasaki Concours only 6K miles! $2500. PO passed away and his wife sold to me. Carbs rebuilt by Shoodabeen Engineering in FL and also had overflow kits and new jets and 2 Minute Mod Jet Kit ($475). New plugs and K&N filter installed. New battery installed last year. I put on Murph's Knee Savers lowered footpegs ($140). I also installed Murph's block-off plates on valve covers($40). No more EGR! Nice trunk w/key also have new key for the sidebags. Good tires w/fresh oil and I will also include 2 K&N oil filters. I also have the Murph's manual petcock kit that I haven't installed yet that I'll include. I also put on a newer windshield. Bike has heated grips also-not working I'm not an electrical dude so I didn't mess with it, likely a fuse or someone pulled the fuse.

Here is a list of spare parts I'll include with the bike:

A spare OEM seat in perfect shape.
A spare J-Box fuse box
A spare Ignitor box
A complete headlight assembly w/bulb in it.
I have the Jbox and ignitor box here in OK, I'll have to ship the head light and seat from GA at my expense.

I have developed a hip problem and can no longer ride the bike in comfort even with the new pegs so I'm moving on. As the pics show, the left mirror is broken off when the bike fell over on soft ground. Still have the old one. A new one from Murph's is $120, maybe we can work something out on that, but as you can see with all the extras and low miles someone is getting a very good deal.

Oh one last thing the PO lost some of the screws from the fairing, just being upfront about it. Good luck but if you don't have the money please don't waste my time and yours. Please call 9 one 8-4 five 8-608 eight. No lowballers, scammers or BS please. Everyone else, thanks for looking!

Runs and rides great!
Everything works

New battery
Custom graphics
Factory Suzuki top bag
Aftermarket side bags, adjustable windscreen, grips, and fog lamps.
Tires are in decent shape
No tears in the seat
Will pass inspection no problem.

Do not let the mileage fool you. Besides a few scratches and scuffs (which is to be expected with this age and mileage), it looks absolutely phenomenal and runs down the road flawlessly. Does not leak anything. 

Calls only! Will not respond to any texts. I have a clean title in my name. NO TRADES! Cash only! Serious inquires only!  
 Thank you!  show contact info

I'm selling my motorcycle because I'm planning to travel in the near future and just haven't been riding it as much as I used to.  If you want to test ride it, you'll need to have the cash for me to hold, and a motorcycle license.  Feel free to contact me with any questions.

I have for sale a 2008 R1 with 28,198 miles. Valve adjustment has been done already so you don't have to worry about that. It runs great, feels great, looks great!

Pro's : Oil changes always on time along with the 25,000 mile maintenance done at RPM Cycles whom also did the valve adjustment. Decent thread on tires and an all around well taken care of motorcycle. Most of the miles were freeway miles from Ventura to Fillmore commute and therefore it has a Pirelli Angel tire in the back. Bike has never been down under my ownership, past owner did scratch it by running into a yellow pole. Galfer ceramic brakes with less that 5k miles on them. 

Con's : Ignition coil #1 is under spec for resistance, I am currently looking for the part which runs $100. Front lights High beams and regulars are out, the previous owner installed after market lights and because I never really rode at night I never found it necessary to look into it. Chain will eventually need to be replaced.

Not a con but oil change is coming up @ 30,000 miles. 

If you are looking for a fun, powerful and sick looking bike than you don't have to look anywhere else. If you are mechanically inclined you can I can knock down $200 that the ignition coil + labor would cost you to replace. 

I can include my Shoei GT Air Helmet which to be honest it might be good as a spare but the visor is pretty scratched as well as my Scorpion Phantom Jacket which I got when I purchased the bike so it has some good miles on it. I am 6'4 and weigh 210. 

Give me a text or email me if you have any questions,

Has approx 19k miles and 3 prior owners.  

Some cosmetic mods but modest.

Recent oil change and brake jobs. 

Tags paid up for the year.

It appears that the PO lowsided and dropped the bike.  Although it's hard to tell.  Was PNO for 2 years before I bought it.  

Price is right, it's a Honda so it will last, and it is quite fast.

Up for sale is my '07 R1 sport bike. It has been regularly maintained with synthetic Mobil 1 racing 4T motor oil only. This bike has <15k on the clock. The fork suspension has just been serviced, with new seals, boots, and oil. The gearing has been changed from OEM to a "power up" configuration, shifting the power band to a more effective, user-friendly (and much more fun) range. This bike has a wet weight of 480 lbs, and has 156 base horsepower. It has Michelin Pilot Power 2CT tires (my favorite for this kind of bike) with plenty of meat left on em. It has some aftermarket features, including custom fairings, custom rear sets, and a few other things. This bike is street legal, with current registration till May, 2019. I'm motivated to sell, so will consider any REASONABLE offer. For a quick sale I'm asking $5000 or best offer. Test ride with collateral (cash or otherwise) and a valid M1 class license only.

$5000

QR Code Link to This Post


I am selling a 2006 Yamaha R1 with 5031 miles.  It used to be a dedicated track bike, which is why it has such low mileage.  It has a clean title and is Non-OP'd, so it can easily be converted back to a street bike if wanted.  The bike comes with an extra, brand new set of Bridgestone BT002's.  This bike is in near immaculate condition and was extremely well maintained.   

THE GOOD:

-Termignoni full Titanium exhaust
-Ohlins steering damper 
-Cycle Cat upper triple clamp 
-Cycle Cat rearsets
-BMC air filter 
-Harris upper/front fairing stay
-Motovation frame and rear axle sliders
-Rizoma brake fluid reservoirs 
-Carbon fiber exhaust shields
-SS brake lines
-LOW MILEAGE
-free set of tires.  Bridgestone BT002's

THE BAD:
-the only negative with this bike is it was lowsided at Thunderhill in turn 11.  It has a dent in the gas tank as a result, and some wear on the left side frame slider and air duct.  please see pics.  only cosmetic damage.


No lowballers.  No test rides without cash in hand and a valid M1.

A lot of bike for the money. Some cosmetic issues, paint scratches, dent in fuel tank. All due to minor low side. The bike is mechanically sound, a fantastic ride with great suspension, tons of power and great brakes. Year 2007, Yamaha corrected fuel injection mapping issues, throttle response is perfect. New brake pads, tires have plenty of tread, ( new Bridgestone rear tire, and set of spark plugs included). I am a 76 year old rider. The bike has been well maintained, no track days, never abused. Only selling because of spouse's  anxiety issues.

A lot of bike for the money. Some cosmetic issues, paint scratches, dent in fuel tank. All due to minor low side. The bike is mechanically sound, a fantastic ride with great suspension, tons of power and great brakes. Year 2007, Yamaha corrected fuel injection mapping issues, throttle response is perfect. New brake pads, tires have plenty of tread, ( new Bridgestone rear tire, and set of spark plugs included). I am a 76 year old rider. The bike has been well maintained, no track days, never abused. Only selling because of spouse's  anxiety issues.
   Some extras: adjustable levers, GYTR carbon exhaust, tail cleanup, flush led turn signals, Yamaha comfy gel seat. Some riding apparel available.

Whether your journey takes you up twisty mountain roads, to busy city centers or on your daily commute, the Multistrada excels wherever there is asphalt. When the engineers at Ducati responded to their design brief with the beautiful and practical 2004 Ducati 1000DS Multistrada, they produced an almost perfect amalgam of high performance sportbike engineering and upright enduro versatility. The Multistrada addresses the fact that on real world roads we are just as likely to encounter battered uneven asphalt as we are glass smooth thoroughfares. The joy of riding the Ducati Multistrada is in the bike's ability to deliver impressive performance on several fronts. Whether it is the juggernaut of a daily commute, or the freedom of the open road as part of a weekend getaway, the Italian mount is at heart what we all want a motorcycle to be fun.

Up for sale is my 03 TL1000r all origional Im the 2nd owner and have ridden it 4 times in the last 3 years. I start it weekly and run it to cycle the gas. I replaced the battery this year 6/18 and had the front shocks rebuilt and a tune up done at Michaels in Reno. Needs chain adjustment and some little picky shit but runs strong and definitely NOT a beginner bike. Hate to see it go but I just don't use it like I should. No Lowballers and No test rides

What I got: 2002 GSX-R 1000 (K2) with: Race Tech suspension internals (F/R), braided brake lines and an Accossato master cylinder up front (stops on a dime), Yoshimura RS3 (stainless/carbon wrap slip-on), Power Commander and externally selectable TRE switch (ride with timing retardation or without, selectable at startup). Rubber is 120x70 / 190x55 Dunlop Sportmax Q3's that are basically brand new (less than 10 hrs riding). All fluids recently changed and battery is brand new as well. External battery tender included. Minor cosmetic "love taps" on upper fairing, right front blinker is out and there is a small crack on the front fairing (from running the 120/70's) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . Single seat config w/ locking trunk.
Mileage is at 29,XXX (I still ride it from time to time, current pic at time of posting of gauges included). 

What you got: Harley Davidson. 
Preference for Dyna, but will consider any reasonable trade such as sportster, Iron, etc. or soft tail. 

I have CIH to balance any trade if need be.

Up for sale is my '07 R1 sport bike. It has been regularly maintained with synthetic Mobil 1 racing 4T motor oil only. This bike has <15k on the clock. The fork suspension has just been serviced, with new seals, boots, and oil. The gearing has been changed from OEM to a "power up" configuration, shifting the power band to a more effective, user-friendly (and much more fun) range. This bike has a wet weight of 480 lbs, and has 156 base horsepower. It has Michelin Pilot Power 2CT tires (my favorite for this kind of bike) with plenty of meat left on em. It has some aftermarket features, including custom fairings, custom rear sets, and a few other things. This bike is street legal, with current registration till May, 2019. I'm motivated to sell, so will consider any REASONABLE offer. For a quick sale I'm asking $5000 or best offer. Test ride with collateral (cash or otherwise) and a valid M1 class license only.

QR Code Link to This Post


I am selling a 2006 Yamaha R1 with 5031 miles.  It used to be a dedicated track bike, which is why it has such low mileage.  It has a clean title and is Non-OP'd, so it can easily be converted back to a street bike if wanted.  The bike comes with an extra, brand new set of Bridgestone BT002's.  This bike is in near immaculate condition and was extremely well maintained.   

THE GOOD:

-Termignoni full Titanium exhaust
-Ohlins steering damper 
-Cycle Cat upper triple clamp 
-Cycle Cat rearsets
-BMC air filter 
-Harris upper/front fairing stay
-Motovation frame and rear axle sliders
-Rizoma brake fluid reservoirs 
-Carbon fiber exhaust shields
-SS brake lines
-LOW MILEAGE
-free set of tires.  Bridgestone BT002's

THE BAD:
-the only negative with this bike is it was lowsided at Thunderhill in turn 11.  It has a dent in the gas tank as a result, and some wear on the left side frame slider and air duct.  please see pics.  only cosmetic damage.


No lowballers.  No test rides without cash in hand and a valid M1.

Very rare - less than 100 sold in the US. This special edition includes fully adjustable Showa suspension, Marelli fuel-injection with 45mm throttle bodies and dual-spark ignition, teflon-coated stainless steel brake lines, 4-piston Brembo brakes, 86 rear-wheel HP. Weighs only 416 pounds. Stock exhaust has been replaced with dual stainless-steel canisters by Remus with carbon-fiber heat shields.

Runs great. Always garaged. Never dropped. Adult owned. Still out-handles almost any other bike in its class. Brand new clutch. Less than 1k miles on Pirelli Angel GT tires. Have all receipts. Too many bikes in the stable. Really sad to see this one go. $3,900. Test rides ok (provided you have cash in hand, Class M license, and insurance.) Scammers go away. This ain't my first rodeo. Eight-oh-Five, 45nine, oh 8 seven six. Call or text preferred.

2003 YAMAHA FZ1 Fast 1000 like R1 Fazer trade for trailer?

$1950

QR Code Link to This Post


I'm selling my 2003 Yamaha FZ-1. It runs good and is very reliable and it's a very fast bike. It has the same engine as the R1 race bike, except Yamaha de-tuned it a bit so it's better for touring. It's one of the most comfortable bikes I've ever owned. I can't ride crotch rockets for very long so this is the next best thing. Great for long rides and it handles great. I'm only selling because I will be moving out of state in a few months and don't want to move it. It has several upgrades from the previous owner as well as some scratches on the side from when he went down at about 10mph. It doesn't effect the bike in any way other than looks. The engine has aftermarket crash guards so there is no engine damage, it just pushed the bars into the tank on one side and cracked the front fairing. I would be willing to trade or partial trade on a trailer for when I move, other than that cash only, and cash in my hand before you even think about riding it, sorry no exceptions, this bike is too fast. Call Tony at 847 nine eight seven 000 three

The upgrades on this bike alone were well over $1500. This has the extremely rare (impossible to find) multi-gauge that replaced the stock fuel gauge with an integrated display that tells, gear position, fuel, speed, temp, etc.

Aftermarket upgrades: 
Sargent Seat $300+  - Extremely more comfort for long rides
Penske Racing rear shock $500+ - fully adjustable
Engine guards $85
Multi-gauge display, was $500 installed - impossible to find, when you can, people still pay $300 for them
Yoshimura Pipe $400 - Sounds sweet
Pirelli Angel GT tires $300 - these are the absolute best tire for a sport-touring bike, I'll never use another tire.

Priced $1000 under KBB for quick sale.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll wait until Spring and relist at MSRP.  

Clean Title on Hand, Current Registration, Starts Right Up, Idles Perfect, Revs Perfect, Shifts Perfect, Original Suzuki Key, and can be ridden home or straight to the canyons~

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.  Learn about it here even if you don't want the bike! https://www.superstreetbike.com/gsx-r1000-in-full-power-mode-can-you-turn-1000-into-600-mythbusters

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Bring your pessimistic mechanic friend and lift her skirt, take her for a test ride, and bring your magnifying glass. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Thanks,
Jake

Hi CL, I'm selling my 2005 FZ1. Broke my leg badly (not riding) and required surgery. Can't ride for 6+ months, and I need the money to pay for the surgery. The bike has been 100% garage kept and responsibly ridden (daily) as a commuter bike. Clean title, registration through May 2019.

- Maintenance within last 3 weeks 
- New Michelin Pilot Road Sport 4 front tire ($140)
- Back tire same model, 70% tread left
New battery ($110)
Oil Change/Filter ($45)
Carb clean and Sync ($200)
Spark Plugs (4 x $5)
Chain Lube (Only half a tank ridden since)

- Specs -
Size: 998cc
Horsepower: 120
MPG: 40-45
Tank Size: 4 gallons
Rear tire: 180
Front tire: 120
weight: 458lb

- Upgrades - 
Shorty adjustable levers
Shortened Exhaust (Not obnoxiously loud, but a sexy loud)
Tinted windscreen
Turn signals (front + back)

The only thing the bike will need in the near future is a new chain (sprocket is ok). Bike starts and runs beautifully regardless of weather or sit time. I love this bike and don't want to sell it, so I want to make sure she goes to a good home. Open to partial trades but need the cash more than anything.

Was a daily but got a new job further away.  I will be moving so my baby has to find a new home. This is a very fun bike and commuting to work I always had a smile on my face.  I also used to ride to Orange county and back on the weekends which is where most of the miles came from.

The Good:
Givi windscreen with adjustable mount
New Battery
Throttle lock (this should be a must for every bike)
Just paid registration, just need sticker for 11/2019
Cheap/removable top case

The bad: 
1. Seat starting to crack and a large crack has developed on the right side.  I would recommend a more comfortable seat anyway, my regret is not buying one.
2. Dusty.   Needs a wash.  Pictures show current state except one from when it was clean.
3. Right side of topcase scratched up.  This is from when I used to park in a garage to make room to walk through.


No trades or tattoos or other offers. Cash only.  Prefer initial email communication.
I work out of town during the week so viewing will need to be on the weekends

2005 Kawasaki Concours - ZG1000

$1300

Hello Everyone, 

I'm selling my 2005 Kawasaki Concours, ZG 1000. 

I love this bike, but I need to sell it. It has one main issue which is why I'm selling for $1300 OBO. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY! Issue listed below.

Like most sport-touring models, this bike has a comfortable seat and is a nice ride with good acceleration. The bike has about 25k miles on it. I've kept and maintained it since I've owned it over the past 2-3 years. I've worked on it myself, but have also taken it in to be serviced at a dealer. 

This bike is great for commuting; It used to be my daily driver for my commute to school and work. I could pack all I needed for the day in my saddle bags and on the luggage rack. The ride is comfortable and still has power when you need it. 

Cosmetic/ Accessories:
1. (2) front pockets 
2. Speakers with AUX cable in front-left pocket
3. 12V receptacle; works with car charger adapters, I use it to charge my phone or iPod when I have my music going.
4. (2) hard-shelled saddle bags
5. Handle bar throttle-lock cruise control
6. Passenger back-rest
7. Small luggage rack base
8. I'm including the recently bought hex-head bolts to replace most of the factory installed ones and the service manual


Maintenance:
1. Recent oil/filter change (About 3 months ago)
2. Coolant flush/replacement
3. Rebuilt master/slave clutch cylinders
4. New front brake pads
5. New rear brake pads (need to be installed)
6. Cleaned out the carburetors when I first bought it
7. Fairly new tires with plenty of tread left

Needs work:
1. The acceleration isn't always there. From the feel of the throttle, it may need to have the clutch disks replaced. (This is why I am selling it; as a student and being recently engaged I can't put any money in to the bike)
2. small oil drip at the oil pan bolt; bought a new washer to be installed, but I haven't installed it because I wanted to buy a magnetic oil pan bolt.
3. Some scratches on the fairings; cracked plastics near the right turn signal.
4. Cracked left mirror

Besides these things, everything works fine. 

NOTE: THE BIKE RUNS AND RIDES, BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND A WAY TO TRANSPORT IT AS PER THE ISSUE LISTED ABOVE

If all this sounds good to you, feel free to email or send a text to (nine zero nine) two six zero - eight six two five AGAIN, ONLY SERIOUS INQUIRES! I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME. I AM OFTEN BUSY FROM 6:30AM-8PM WEEKDAYS SO WEEKENDS ARE THE BEST TIME TO LOOK AT THE BIKE. I will respond more quickly to text, so text is preferred!

For sale is my 2008 cbr 1000rr. Was my daily rider for a year and a half. From the first owner I got it from at 5k miles. I took it to the mechanic because I heard a rattling one day. They told me it was fine sand into the engine through the airbox and it'll need a new engine unfortunately. This bike was really fun and I hate to sell it like this, but I had already planned on using this bike as a downpayment on another bike and now plans have changed. All services were done on the bike. All parts work and bike still runs (mechanic said rattling will get louder the more its ridden) since everything else works that's why I am starting at a high asking price. I had also recently put new brakes and had new fork seals put onto the bike no more than 3000 miles ago. 

Someone who's willing to replace the engine will have a really fun bike on their hands. Will add pictures when possible.

Mods:

Two brothers exhaust with midpipe and fender eliminator kit (previous owner)

520 chain conversion ~5000 miles ago

Pirelli Angel GT tires ~50% tread

Aftermarket levers

Priced $1000 below KBB for quick sale.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll wait until Spring and relist at MSRP.

This GSXR1000 has a Clean California Title on hand, original matching key & spare, current registration, starts right up, the 6-speed high-compression race engine revs cleanly and smoothly (please let her warm up first) and shifts perfectly. She's FULLY serviced and will require no supplementary costs to be road worthy.

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Thanks,
Jake

Clean Title
Willing to negiotiate
The bike is $2400 because there is a ticking noise and I don't have the money to chase this issue and pay for it.
I put all my love into this bike and I'm sad to have to get rid of it for college.
This bike has had maintenance whenever it needed it.
Below is a list of important factors about this bike:
Brand new cam chain tensioner, oil, and oil filter. I rode the bike home 2 miles and haven't rode it since the shop did this.
Brand new clutch cable replaced after it broke.
The entire front triple tree was ripped out and replaced.
Relatively new front and bike Michelin Road 5 tires.
Brand new front rotors.
Upgraded suspension.
Adjustable brake lever.
Upgraded sprocket (2 teeth down in the front, 3 teeth up in the back).

I'm sure there's more I'm leaving out, but contact me if you have any questions about the bike.

2005 Kawasaki Concours - ZG1000

Hello Everyone, 

I'm selling my 2005 Kawasaki Concours, ZG 1000. 

I love this bike, but I need to sell it. It has one main issue which is why I'm selling for $1300 OBO. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY! Issue listed below.

Like most sport-touring models, this bike has a comfortable seat and is a nice ride with good acceleration. The bike has about 25k miles on it. I've kept and maintained it since I've owned it over the past 2-3 years. I've worked on it myself, but have also taken it in to be serviced at a dealer. 

This bike is great for commuting; It used to be my daily driver for my commute to school and work. I could pack all I needed for the day in my saddle bags and on the luggage rack. The ride is comfortable and still has power when you need it. 

Cosmetic/ Accessories:
1. (2) front pockets 
2. Speakers with AUX cable in front-left pocket
3. 12V receptacle; works with car charger adapters, I use it to charge my phone or iPod when I have my music going.
4. (2) hard-shelled saddle bags
5. Handle bar throttle-lock cruise control
6. Passenger back-rest
7. Small luggage rack base
8. I'm including the recently bought hex-head bolts to replace most of the factory installed ones and the service manual


Maintenance:
1. Recent oil/filter change (About 3 months ago)
2. Coolant flush/replacement
3. Rebuilt master/slave clutch cylinders
4. New front brake pads
5. New rear brake pads (need to be installed)
6. Cleaned out the carburetors when I first bought it
7. Fairly new tires with plenty of tread left

Needs work:
1. The acceleration isn't always there. From the feel of the throttle, it may need to have the clutch disks replaced. (This is why I am selling it; as a student and being recently engaged I can't put any money in to the bike)
2. small oil drip at the oil pan bolt; bought a new washer to be installed, but I haven't installed it because I wanted to buy a magnetic oil pan bolt.
3. Some scratches on the fairings; cracked plastics near the right turn signal.
4. Cracked left mirror

Besides these things, everything works fine. 

NOTE: THE BIKE RUNS AND RIDES, BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND A WAY TO TRANSPORT IT AS PER THE ISSUE LISTED ABOVE

If all this sounds good to you, feel free to email or send a text to (nine zero nine) two six zero - eight six two five AGAIN, ONLY SERIOUS INQUIRES! I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME. I AM OFTEN BUSY FROM 6:30AM-8PM WEEKDAYS SO WEEKENDS ARE THE BEST TIME TO LOOK AT THE BIKE. I will respond more quickly to text, so text is preferred!

For sale is my 2008 cbr 1000rr. Was my daily rider for a year and a half. From the first owner I got it from at 5k miles. I took it to the mechanic because I heard a rattling one day. They told me it was fine sand into the engine through the airbox and it'll need a new engine unfortunately. This bike was really fun and I hate to sell it like this, but I had already planned on using this bike as a downpayment on another bike and now plans have changed. All services were done on the bike. All parts work and bike still runs (mechanic said rattling will get louder the more its ridden) since everything else works that's why I am starting at a high asking price. I had also recently put new brakes and had new fork seals put onto the bike no more than 3000 miles ago. 

Someone who's willing to replace the engine will have a really fun bike on their hands. Will add pictures when possible.

Mods:

Two brothers exhaust with midpipe and fender eliminator kit (previous owner)

520 chain conversion ~5000 miles ago

Pirelli Angel GT tires ~50% tread

Aftermarket levers

Priced $1000 below KBB for quick sale.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll wait until Spring and relist at MSRP.

This GSXR1000 has a Clean California Title on hand, original matching key & spare, current registration, starts right up, the 6-speed high-compression race engine revs cleanly and smoothly (please let her warm up first) and shifts perfectly. She's FULLY serviced and will require no supplementary costs to be road worthy.

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Thanks,
Jake

Clean Title
Willing to negiotiate
The bike is $2400 because there is a ticking noise and I don't have the money to chase this issue and pay for it.
I put all my love into this bike and I'm sad to have to get rid of it for college.
This bike has had maintenance whenever it needed it.
Below is a list of important factors about this bike:
Brand new cam chain tensioner, oil, and oil filter. I rode the bike home 2 miles and haven't rode it since the shop did this.
Brand new clutch cable replaced after it broke.
The entire front triple tree was ripped out and replaced.
Relatively new front and bike Michelin Road 5 tires.
Brand new front rotors.
Upgraded suspension.
Adjustable brake lever.
Upgraded sprocket (2 teeth down in the front, 3 teeth up in the back).

I'm sure there's more I'm leaving out, but contact me if you have any questions about the bike.

2003 Cagiva V-Raptor

2003 CAGIVA RAPTOR a/k/a Ducati Monster 2: very rare, excellent shape!

$2899

QR Code Link to This Post


Up for sale is my 2003 Cagiva V-Raptor 1000. This model started the "praying mantis" style semi-naked bikes. I think its one of the most unique looking bikes in recent years. It's also rare: I believe there are only about 5 Cagiva Raptors in the U.S., and that this is the only V-Raptor model in the country.

History: the Cagiva Raptor was intended to be an alternative to the Ducati Monster and it was designed by the same man who penned the Monster (Galuzzi designed both since Ducati & Cagiva used to be sister companies). While the Monster has an expensive to repair and sometimes tempermental Ducati motor, Cagiva sourced a more powerful 1000 CC V-twin motor from Suzuki - the same motor as Suzuki used in their legendry 1000TL (known as a very fast bike).

Cagiva says the Suzuki motor makes about 112 HP in the V-Raptor - a lot for a bike this light. Best of all: the Suzuki motor is proven, reliable, is not expensive to get parts for if needed, and can be serviced or repaired at just about any motorcycle mechanic or Suzuki dealership. And it is the same motor as used in the Bimota SB8R. 

I bought this bike about a year ago. Since buying it, I had the tank and fairings painted matte white (painter did a good job, not perfect -- but it looks very cool). I installed a different set of bars ("Driven" brand - wider than what it came with for greater comfort). I instaled new mini mirrors and grips. I replaced the headlight bulb with a Silverstar Ultra High Performace bulb and the driving light bulb with an LED bulb.

I also relaced the pipes it came with with a brand new set of Ducati 1088 pipes. I changed the front brake reservoir, changed the brake fluid and bled front and rear brakes. I put in a new battery and clutch cable. I had the radiator pressure tested and flushed and replaced the coolant. I did an oil and filter change and changed the spark plugs (NGK). It has a pretty fresh set of matched expensive Michellin tires. 

Everything that looks like carbon fiber on the bike actually is (except the carbon looking "Cagiva" protective sticker on the engine cover). A prior owner replaced the front fender, the tank "cowls" & the side covers with real carbon parts. The tank, upper fairing and lower fairing are a PVC material material, the rear fender has been deleted, etc....not a lot of fat on this bike. The rear pillion is removeable and there is a passenger seat.

I have been wanting to get the correct front turn signals that fit in the openings in the fairing: the ones on now will work fine, but I haven't wired them up yet. I have also been looking for a new wind screen - this one has been painted matte black and looks good, but it has damage noticeable on inspection. I noticed a drop of oil under the bike last week - I did not change the crush washer when I did the oil change so that may be it.

Starts easy. Runs and shifts well. Does not smoke. All lights and horn work. 
Comes with original pipes, original bars, original mirrors, original "cowl", a box of extras and spares, etc...
48K Miles. Has valid California registration with no back due fees or penalties and a clean title in my name.

Other bikes of this generation (Italian and japanese) will just go down in value - this  one will hold and appreciate due to rarity.
$2,899

***NO SCAMMERS - I will report you. Also, I DO NOT need help selling this motorcycle*** 

Thanks...

Priced $1000 under KBB to sell fast.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll be waiting until Spring and reposting for actual MSRP.

This GSX-R goes 300kph. 190mph. This thing is F.A.S.T. and priced right if you're willing to get into that seat in the budget trim. This bike has more upgrades than I can even list. I will include F.R.E.E. extras in the sale whichever level you choose (see below)~

Clean Title. Current Registration. Starts right up. Fully Serviced. No problems. Needs Nothing. Low Miles. Ready to Canyon, Commute, or Careen at the Track.

This GSXR has Power Modes which literally turn the bike into a 600, 750, or the full 1000 beast. Push of a button, takes 2 seconds.  It's a very cool option for tight technical canyons or close-quarter lane-splitting.

Option 1: As pictured, with those $$$ Carrozzeria Wheels, Brembo Brakes, and many more goodies not seen: $7500
Option 2: Stock Wheels & Brakes, Full Two Bros Black Series & Mystery Door #2 goodies: $5500
Option 3: Don't upsale me with wheels and flashy name-brand stuff, the stock version is fast enough! $5000

Free Delivery, Just detailed the bike, or bring your pessimistic mechanic and lift her skirt in person~

Never been able to use this line when selling one of my bikes...

Accident forces sale. Or to be more accurate - some asshole without insurance or a driver's licence hit me on my way to work and jacked up my shoulder and a year of my life.... I can't ride for another several months. Bike to good home.

2011 Honda CB1000R. 
Registered.
Clear title in hand.
I'm the second owner. Previous owner worked for American Honda, so the bike was taken care of prior to my taking possession.
28900 well cared for miles.
I purchased the bike with 12000miles on the odo. 
I've used this bike for commuting only.  No track days. Hadn't even gotten a chance to hang it out in the canyons...
4.2 gallon gas tank and I can reliably get 140miles/tank exceeding the speed limit at all times. Naked bike, no fairing = great gas mileage is what i'm saying.

Bike is buttery smooth as to be expected for a well sorted Honda inline 4. 
Arkapovic titanium muffler with carbon fiber endcap and actual mid-pipe! True 4 into 1. Not loud, no gimmicky sounding bullshit eBay exhaust. 
Power commander to manage fuel, runs great at all rpm and all angles.....
Fabbri windscreen not installed. It works. I took it off for the photos.
New Michelin Pilot Road 5 tires front and rear - not even scrubbed in yet.

As I alluded to up top. I was hit on the 405 back in May. My body took the brunt of the low speed impact. I'm still recovering from shoulder surgery. The bike was knocked out from under me.
Clutch cover was scraped. Right handlebar was scraped. Right mirror was scrapped. That's it! Bike ran when picked up. Too bad I wasn't in running condition after.
Anyway...New bars, bar ends, grips, mirrors, clutch cover, clutch cover bolts and the bike looks just as good as it did before that shithead hit me. I'm not bitter. Not at all....

You can have the take off parts if you want them. 
Not trying to hide anything. Bike runs great. 
Test ride if you have cash in hand or leave me the keys to your truck.....and a motorcycle endorsement on your license. That's actually a deal breaker for me. Go figure. Bring a helmet too because you can't borrow mine. That's just gross. And weird.

Email me your cell number, I'll text you back and you can check it out.

Great bike. I'm retired and having neck surgery so my riding days are done. Time for an RV. Only owner and only rider. Many extra's including Power Commander 5, Two Bros Pipes, Center Stand, Factory Gel Seat, Givi 43 liter top box w/ Givi mounting gear, Givi engine guards, Madstad Bracket w/ Givi tall windscreen, Battery Tender Jr and cords and for an extra $50 I'll include a pair of fleece lined Hippo Hands which are priceless in colder weather. Oh and it has heated grips as well. Cash only and I mean currency. No checks. It has been a great commuter for me and a great bike for canyons and coastal routes. It has started every time I pressed the starter without fail. I've worked in a bike shop for the last 13 years that has Suzuki as one of it's lines so you can count on it being very well maintained. Never more than 3500 between oil changes. Only Motul 5100 in the engine. Serious people only please. KBB excellent condition is $4500 but I know the miles are a bit high for some so hence the lower price. Tires are also in good shape. Michelin Pilot Road 3's with easily 10k left. I also have a spare air filter and brake pads that I'm including.
Just renewed plates. Be happy to go to AAA with you to insure smooth transfer. Please email if you have questions or would like to come and see it.
Also will include a lot of riding gear if you're a large guy like me, 6'2...250... Jackets, gloves cold pants and cold weather riding suit. Bout $1000+ of gear...

Hello CL, up for sale is this fuel injected 1000cc torque monster! 
   This bike is tastefully modified and has been adult owened and never stunted or abused. Completely updated suspension from a zx10 with the large radial mounted brakes for better stopping power rounding off the braking is a brembo RSC 19 master cylinder with steel braided brake lines with EBC HH brake pads to better clamp the rotors. Fenomenal stopping power!
Outback is the Zx10 rear shock for better handling, Dunlop q3's for better cornering. New chain kit with one tooth up outback along with a custom machined flywheel for great acceleration new Barnett clutch and clutch cable for smooth action. Rounding off the power is a FULL TITANIUM PIPE made by Mr. Kawasaki Rob "Muzzy" power commander K&N air. Filter with a custom modified air box for better air flow. That's just on tap, regularly maintained with primium motorcycle specific fluids including primium gasoline. 
   This bike is solid and very reliable.  Unfortunately the previous owner lowsided it at low speed so there is a small flat spot on the tank and road rash on the fairing it's only cosmetic flaws that does not affect the performance. I purchased this bike completely stock and modified it to my liking, those that know about motorcycles and motorcycle performance can see and appreciate the modifications. The seating position on this bike is very comfortable almost dirt bike like therefore splitting lanes on the gridlocked freeways is easy peasy! Plus the pipe sounds loud enough to warn motorists.

I have for sale a 2008 R1 with 28,198 miles. Valve adjustment has been done already so you don't have to worry about that. It runs great, feels great, looks great!

Pro's : Oil changes always on time along with the 25,000 mile maintenance done at RPM Cycles whom also did the valve adjustment. Decent thread on tires and an all around well taken care of motorcycle. Most of the miles were freeway miles from Ventura to Fillmore commute and therefore it has a Pirelli Angel tire in the back. Bike has never been down under my ownership, past owner did scratch it by running into a yellow pole. Galfer ceramic brakes with less that 5k miles on them. 

Con's : Ignition coil #1 is under spec for resistance, I am currently looking for the part which runs $100. Front lights High beams and regulars are out, the previous owner installed after market lights and because I never really rode at night I never found it necessary to look into it. Chain will eventually need to be replaced.

Not a con but oil change is coming up @ 30,000 miles. 

If you are looking for a fun, powerful and sick looking bike than you don't have to look anywhere else. If you are mechanically inclined you can I can knock down $200 that the ignition coil + labor would cost you to replace. 

I can include my Shoei GT Air Helmet which to be honest it might be good as a spare but the visor is pretty scratched as well as my Scorpion Phantom Jacket which I got when I purchased the bike so it has some good miles on it. I am 6'4 and weigh 210. 

Give me a text or email me if you have any questions,

QR Code Link to This Post


I'm selling my 2003 Yamaha FZ-1. It runs good and is very reliable and it's a very fast bike. It has the same engine as the R1 race bike, except Yamaha de-tuned it a bit so it's better for touring. It's one of the most comfortable bikes I've ever owned. I can't ride crotch rockets for very long so this is the next best thing. Great for long rides and it handles great. I'm only selling because I will be moving out of state in a few months and don't want to move it. It has several upgrades from the previous owner as well as some scratches on the side from when he went down at about 10mph. It doesn't effect the bike in any way other than looks. The engine has aftermarket crash guards so there is no engine damage, it just pushed the bars into the tank on one side and cracked the front fairing. I would be willing to trade or partial trade on a trailer for when I move, other than that cash only, and cash in my hand before you even think about riding it, sorry no exceptions, this bike is too fast. Call Tony at 847 nine eight seven 000 three

The upgrades on this bike alone were well over $1500. This has the extremely rare (impossible to find) multi-gauge that replaced the stock fuel gauge with an integrated display that tells, gear position, fuel, speed, temp, etc.

Aftermarket upgrades: 
Sargent Seat $300+  - Extremely more comfort for long rides
Penske Racing rear shock $500+ - fully adjustable
Engine guards $85
Multi-gauge display, was $500 installed - impossible to find, when you can, people still pay $300 for them
Yoshimura Pipe $400 - Sounds sweet
Pirelli Angel GT tires $300 - these are the absolute best tire for a sport-touring bike, I'll never use another tire.

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.  Learn about it here even if you don't want the bike! https://www.superstreetbike.com/gsx-r1000-in-full-power-mode-can-you-turn-1000-into-600-mythbusters

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Bring your pessimistic mechanic friend and lift her skirt, take her for a test ride, and bring your magnifying glass. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Thanks,
Jake

Was a daily but got a new job further away.  I will be moving so my baby has to find a new home. This is a very fun bike and commuting to work I always had a smile on my face.  I also used to ride to Orange county and back on the weekends which is where most of the miles came from.

The Good:
Givi windscreen with adjustable mount
New Battery
Throttle lock (this should be a must for every bike)
Just paid registration, just need sticker for 11/2019
Cheap/removable top case

The bad: 
1. Seat starting to crack and a large crack has developed on the right side.  I would recommend a more comfortable seat anyway, my regret is not buying one.
2. Dusty.   Needs a wash.  Pictures show current state except one from when it was clean.
3. Right side of topcase scratched up.  This is from when I used to park in a garage to make room to walk through.


No trades or tattoos or other offers. Cash only.  Prefer initial email communication.
I work out of town during the week so viewing will need to be on the weekends

2003 CAGIVA RAPTOR a/k/a Ducati Monster 2: very rare, excellent shape!

$2899

QR Code Link to This Post


Up for sale is my 2003 Cagiva V-Raptor 1000. This model started the "praying mantis" style semi-naked bikes. I think its one of the most unique looking bikes in recent years. It's also rare: I believe there are only about 5 Cagiva Raptors in the U.S., and that this is the only V-Raptor model in the country.

History: the Cagiva Raptor was intended to be an alternative to the Ducati Monster and it was designed by the same man who penned the Monster (Galuzzi designed both since Ducati & Cagiva used to be sister companies). While the Monster has an expensive to repair and sometimes tempermental Ducati motor, Cagiva sourced a more powerful 1000 CC V-twin motor from Suzuki - the same motor as Suzuki used in their legendry 1000TL (known as a very fast bike).

Cagiva says the Suzuki motor makes about 112 HP in the V-Raptor - a lot for a bike this light. Best of all: the Suzuki motor is proven, reliable, is not expensive to get parts for if needed, and can be serviced or repaired at just about any motorcycle mechanic or Suzuki dealership. And it is the same motor as used in the Bimota SB8R. 

I bought this bike about a year ago. Since buying it, I had the tank and fairings painted matte white (painter did a good job, not perfect -- but it looks very cool). I installed a different set of bars ("Driven" brand - wider than what it came with for greater comfort). I instaled new mini mirrors and grips. I replaced the headlight bulb with a Silverstar Ultra High Performace bulb and the driving light bulb with an LED bulb.

I also relaced the pipes it came with with a brand new set of Ducati 1088 pipes. I changed the front brake reservoir, changed the brake fluid and bled front and rear brakes. I put in a new battery and clutch cable. I had the radiator pressure tested and flushed and replaced the coolant. I did an oil and filter change and changed the spark plugs (NGK). It has a pretty fresh set of matched expensive Michellin tires. 

Everything that looks like carbon fiber on the bike actually is (except the carbon looking "Cagiva" protective sticker on the engine cover). A prior owner replaced the front fender, the tank "cowls" & the side covers with real carbon parts. The tank, upper fairing and lower fairing are a PVC material material, the rear fender has been deleted, etc....not a lot of fat on this bike. The rear pillion is removeable and there is a passenger seat.

I have been wanting to get the correct front turn signals that fit in the openings in the fairing: the ones on now will work fine, but I haven't wired them up yet. I have also been looking for a new wind screen - this one has been painted matte black and looks good, but it has damage noticeable on inspection. I noticed a drop of oil under the bike last week - I did not change the crush washer when I did the oil change so that may be it.

Starts easy. Runs and shifts well. Does not smoke. All lights and horn work. 
Comes with original pipes, original bars, original mirrors, original "cowl", a box of extras and spares, etc...
48K Miles. Has valid California registration with no back due fees or penalties and a clean title in my name.

Other bikes of this generation (Italian and japanese) will just go down in value - this  one will hold and appreciate due to rarity.
$2,899

***NO SCAMMERS - I will report you. Also, I DO NOT need help selling this motorcycle*** 

Thanks...

Priced $1000 under KBB to sell fast.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll be waiting until Spring and reposting for actual MSRP.

This GSX-R goes 300kph. 190mph. This thing is F.A.S.T. and priced right if you're willing to get into that seat in the budget trim. This bike has more upgrades than I can even list. I will include F.R.E.E. extras in the sale whichever level you choose (see below)~

Clean Title. Current Registration. Starts right up. Fully Serviced. No problems. Needs Nothing. Low Miles. Ready to Canyon, Commute, or Careen at the Track.

This GSXR has Power Modes which literally turn the bike into a 600, 750, or the full 1000 beast. Push of a button, takes 2 seconds.  It's a very cool option for tight technical canyons or close-quarter lane-splitting.

Option 1: As pictured, with those $$$ Carrozzeria Wheels, Brembo Brakes, and many more goodies not seen: $7500
Option 2: Stock Wheels & Brakes, Full Two Bros Black Series & Mystery Door #2 goodies: $5500
Option 3: Don't upsale me with wheels and flashy name-brand stuff, the stock version is fast enough! $5000

Free Delivery, Just detailed the bike, or bring your pessimistic mechanic and lift her skirt in person~

Awesome 2007 Ducati Monster S2R 1000 up for sale. The S2R has the single sided swingarm that most regular monsters did not have and it is the 1000cc version (there was a 800 s2r) honestly I  really like this bike and it is great but I have been doing more track riding and want a track bike. The bike runs great and sounds great, Houston Super Bikes tuned the ECU. Awesome bike for what ever you want to do, commuting or canyons or track it is great.

Never been able to use this line when selling one of my bikes...

Accident forces sale. Or to be more accurate - some asshole without insurance or a driver's licence hit me on my way to work and jacked up my shoulder and a year of my life.... I can't ride for another several months. Bike to good home.

2011 Honda CB1000R. 
Registered.
Clear title in hand.
I'm the second owner. Previous owner worked for American Honda, so the bike was taken care of prior to my taking possession.
28900 well cared for miles.
I purchased the bike with 12000miles on the odo. 
I've used this bike for commuting only.  No track days. Hadn't even gotten a chance to hang it out in the canyons...
4.2 gallon gas tank and I can reliably get 140miles/tank exceeding the speed limit at all times. Naked bike, no fairing = great gas mileage is what i'm saying.

Bike is buttery smooth as to be expected for a well sorted Honda inline 4. 
Arkapovic titanium muffler with carbon fiber endcap and actual mid-pipe! True 4 into 1. Not loud, no gimmicky sounding bullshit eBay exhaust. 
Power commander to manage fuel, runs great at all rpm and all angles.....
Fabbri windscreen not installed. It works. I took it off for the photos.
New Michelin Pilot Road 5 tires front and rear - not even scrubbed in yet.

As I alluded to up top. I was hit on the 405 back in May. My body took the brunt of the low speed impact. I'm still recovering from shoulder surgery. The bike was knocked out from under me.
Clutch cover was scraped. Right handlebar was scraped. Right mirror was scrapped. That's it! Bike ran when picked up. Too bad I wasn't in running condition after.
Anyway...New bars, bar ends, grips, mirrors, clutch cover, clutch cover bolts and the bike looks just as good as it did before that shithead hit me. I'm not bitter. Not at all....

You can have the take off parts if you want them. 
Not trying to hide anything. Bike runs great. 
Test ride if you have cash in hand or leave me the keys to your truck.....and a motorcycle endorsement on your license. That's actually a deal breaker for me. Go figure. Bring a helmet too because you can't borrow mine. That's just gross. And weird.

Email me your cell number, I'll text you back and you can check it out.

Great bike. I'm retired and having neck surgery so my riding days are done. Time for an RV. Only owner and only rider. Many extra's including Power Commander 5, Two Bros Pipes, Center Stand, Factory Gel Seat, Givi 43 liter top box w/ Givi mounting gear, Givi engine guards, Madstad Bracket w/ Givi tall windscreen, Battery Tender Jr and cords and for an extra $50 I'll include a pair of fleece lined Hippo Hands which are priceless in colder weather. Oh and it has heated grips as well. Cash only and I mean currency. No checks. It has been a great commuter for me and a great bike for canyons and coastal routes. It has started every time I pressed the starter without fail. I've worked in a bike shop for the last 13 years that has Suzuki as one of it's lines so you can count on it being very well maintained. Never more than 3500 between oil changes. Only Motul 5100 in the engine. Serious people only please. KBB excellent condition is $4500 but I know the miles are a bit high for some so hence the lower price. Tires are also in good shape. Michelin Pilot Road 3's with easily 10k left. I also have a spare air filter and brake pads that I'm including.
Just renewed plates. Be happy to go to AAA with you to insure smooth transfer. Please email if you have questions or would like to come and see it.
Also will include a lot of riding gear if you're a large guy like me, 6'2...250... Jackets, gloves cold pants and cold weather riding suit. Bout $1000+ of gear...

Hello CL, up for sale is this fuel injected 1000cc torque monster! 
   This bike is tastefully modified and has been adult owened and never stunted or abused. Completely updated suspension from a zx10 with the large radial mounted brakes for better stopping power rounding off the braking is a brembo RSC 19 master cylinder with steel braided brake lines with EBC HH brake pads to better clamp the rotors. Fenomenal stopping power!
Outback is the Zx10 rear shock for better handling, Dunlop q3's for better cornering. New chain kit with one tooth up outback along with a custom machined flywheel for great acceleration new Barnett clutch and clutch cable for smooth action. Rounding off the power is a FULL TITANIUM PIPE made by Mr. Kawasaki Rob "Muzzy" power commander K&N air. Filter with a custom modified air box for better air flow. That's just on tap, regularly maintained with primium motorcycle specific fluids including primium gasoline. 
   This bike is solid and very reliable.  Unfortunately the previous owner lowsided it at low speed so there is a small flat spot on the tank and road rash on the fairing it's only cosmetic flaws that does not affect the performance. I purchased this bike completely stock and modified it to my liking, those that know about motorcycles and motorcycle performance can see and appreciate the modifications. The seating position on this bike is very comfortable almost dirt bike like therefore splitting lanes on the gridlocked freeways is easy peasy! Plus the pipe sounds loud enough to warn motorists. NOW That said, serious buyers only CASH ONLY! Scammers will be ignored no trades CASH ONLY! No payments CASH ONLY! No shipping COD ONLY! NO Military shipping of any kind CASH ONLY!

For sale is my 2008 cbr 1000rr. Was my daily rider for a year and a half. From the first owner I got it from at 5k miles. I took it to the mechanic because I heard a rattling one day. They told me it was fine sand into the engine through the airbox and it'll need a new engine unfortunately. This bike was really fun and I hate to sell it like this, but I had already planned on using this bike as a downpayment on another bike and now plans have changed. All services were done on the bike. All parts work and bike still runs (mechanic said rattling will get louder the more its ridden) since everything else works that's why I am starting at a high asking price. I had also recently put new brakes and had new fork seals put onto the bike no more than 3000 miles ago. 

Someone who's willing to replace the engine will have a really fun bike on their hands. Will add pictures when possible.

Mods:

Two brothers exhaust with midpipe and fender eliminator kit (previous owner)

520 chain conversion ~5000 miles ago

Pirelli Angel GT tires ~50% tread

Aftermarket levers

Priced $1000 below KBB for quick sale.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll wait until Spring and relist at MSRP.

This GSXR1000 has a Clean California Title on hand, original matching key & spare, current registration, starts right up, the 6-speed high-compression race engine revs cleanly and smoothly (please let her warm up first) and shifts perfectly. She's FULLY serviced and will require no supplementary costs to be road worthy.

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Thanks,
Jake

Awesome 2007 Ducati Monster S2R 1000 up for sale. The S2R has the single sided swingarm that most regular monsters did not have and it is the 1000cc version (there was a 800 s2r) honestly I really like this bike and it is great but I have been doing more track riding and want a track bike. The bike runs great and sounds great, Houston Super Bikes tuned the ECU. Awesome bike for what ever you want to do, commuting or canyons or track it is great.

Clean Title
Willing to negiotiate
The bike is $2400 because there is a ticking noise and I don't have the money to chase this issue and pay for it.
I put all my love into this bike and I'm sad to have to get rid of it for college.
This bike has had maintenance whenever it needed it.
Below is a list of important factors about this bike:
Brand new cam chain tensioner, oil, and oil filter. I rode the bike home 2 miles and haven't rode it since the shop did this.
Brand new clutch cable replaced after it broke.
The entire front triple tree was ripped out and replaced.
Relatively new front and bike Michelin Road 5 tires.
Brand new front rotors.
Upgraded suspension.
Adjustable brake lever.
Upgraded sprocket (2 teeth down in the front, 3 teeth up in the back).

I'm sure there's more I'm leaving out, but contact me if you have any questions about the bike.

2005 Kawasaki Concours - ZG1000

$1300

Hello Everyone, 

I'm selling my 2005 Kawasaki Concours, ZG 1000. 

I love this bike, but I need to sell it. It has one main issue which is why I'm selling for $1300 OBO. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY! Issue listed below.

Like most sport-touring models, this bike has a comfortable seat and is a nice ride with good acceleration. The bike has about 25k miles on it. I've kept and maintained it since I've owned it over the past 2-3 years. I've worked on it myself, but have also taken it in to be serviced at a dealer. 

This bike is great for commuting; It used to be my daily driver for my commute to school and work. I could pack all I needed for the day in my saddle bags and on the luggage rack. The ride is comfortable and still has power when you need it. 

Cosmetic/ Accessories:
1. (2) front pockets 
2. Speakers with AUX cable in front-left pocket
3. 12V receptacle; works with car charger adapters, I use it to charge my phone or iPod when I have my music going.
4. (2) hard-shelled saddle bags
5. Handle bar throttle-lock cruise control
6. Passenger back-rest
7. Small luggage rack base
8. I'm including the recently bought hex-head bolts to replace most of the factory installed ones and the service manual


Maintenance:
1. Recent oil/filter change (About 3 months ago)
2. Coolant flush/replacement
3. Rebuilt master/slave clutch cylinders
4. New front brake pads
5. New rear brake pads (need to be installed)
6. Cleaned out the carburetors when I first bought it
7. Fairly new tires with plenty of tread left

Needs work:
1. The acceleration isn't always there. From the feel of the throttle, it may need to have the clutch disks replaced. (This is why I am selling it; as a student and being recently engaged I can't put any money in to the bike)
2. small oil drip at the oil pan bolt; bought a new washer to be installed, but I haven't installed it because I wanted to buy a magnetic oil pan bolt.
3. Some scratches on the fairings; cracked plastics near the right turn signal.
4. Cracked left mirror

Besides these things, everything works fine. 

NOTE: THE BIKE RUNS AND RIDES, BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND A WAY TO TRANSPORT IT AS PER THE ISSUE LISTED ABOVE

If all this sounds good to you, feel free to email or send a text to (nine zero nine) two six zero - eight six two five AGAIN, ONLY SERIOUS INQUIRES! I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME. I AM OFTEN BUSY FROM 6:30AM-8PM WEEKDAYS SO WEEKENDS ARE THE BEST TIME TO LOOK AT THE BIKE. I will respond more quickly to text, so text is preferred!

I'm selling my 2006 Buell Lightning City X.  It is totally customized... custom windscreen, custom mirror, K&N air filter, dual carbon fiber air scoops, carbon fiber turn signals, carbon fiber rider and passenger heel guards, carbon fiber license plate frame, Buell logo tank guard, custom D&D exhaust, custom tail end, rear slider pegs, and a race chip with tuning done on the dyno at Harley-Davidson.  The Pirelli Scorpion tires are practically new.  I am the original owner and it has always been garage kept.  It has never been downed and has a clean title.  The registration is current until October 2018.  I'm also throwing in a carbon fiber Buell logo helmet and Buell logo armored gloves (both like new), a trickle charger, a waterproof cover, Buell logo beanie, Buell logo scarf, and a framed Buell logo emblem.  I also have some of the original parts boxed up as well.

I'm selling my motorcycle because I'm planning to travel in the near future and just haven't been riding it as much as I used to.  If you want to test ride it, you'll need to have the cash for me to hold, and a motorcycle license.  Feel free to contact me with any questions.

I have for sale a 2008 R1 with 28,198 miles. Valve adjustment has been done already so you don't have to worry about that. It runs great, feels great, looks great!

Pro's : Oil changes always on time along with the 25,000 mile maintenance done at RPM Cycles whom also did the valve adjustment. Decent thread on tires and an all around well taken care of motorcycle. Most of the miles were freeway miles from Ventura to Fillmore commute and therefore it has a Pirelli Angel tire in the back. Bike has never been down under my ownership, past owner did scratch it by running into a yellow pole. Galfer ceramic brakes with less that 5k miles on them. 

Con's : Ignition coil #1 is under spec for resistance, I am currently looking for the part which runs $100. Front lights High beams and regulars are out, the previous owner installed after market lights and because I never really rode at night I never found it necessary to look into it. Chain will eventually need to be replaced.

Not a con but oil change is coming up @ 30,000 miles. 

If you are looking for a fun, powerful and sick looking bike than you don't have to look anywhere else. If you are mechanically inclined you can I can knock down $200 that the ignition coil + labor would cost you to replace. 

I can include my Shoei GT Air Helmet which to be honest it might be good as a spare but the visor is pretty scratched as well as my Scorpion Phantom Jacket which I got when I purchased the bike so it has some good miles on it. I am 6'4 and weigh 210. 

Give me a text or email me if you have any questions,

Bike rides perfect, smooth on acceleration and the twisties.  

Has approx 19k miles and 3 prior owners.  

Some cosmetic mods but modest.

Recent oil change and brake jobs. 

Tags paid up for the year.

It appears that the PO lowsided and dropped the bike.  Although it's hard to tell.  Was PNO for 2 years before I bought it.  

Price is right, it's a Honda so it will last, and it is quite fast.

It has some aftermarket features, including custom fairings, custom rear sets, and a few other things. This bike is street legal, with current registration till May, 2019. I'm motivated to sell, so will consider any REASONABLE offer. For a quick sale I'm asking $5000 or best offer. Test ride with collateral (cash or otherwise) and a valid M1 class license only.

$5000

QR Code Link to This Post


I am selling a 2006 Yamaha R1 with 5031 miles.  It used to be a dedicated track bike, which is why it has such low mileage.  It has a clean title and is Non-OP'd, so it can easily be converted back to a street bike if wanted.  The bike comes with an extra, brand new set of Bridgestone BT002's.  This bike is in near immaculate condition and was extremely well maintained.   

THE GOOD:

-Termignoni full Titanium exhaust
-Ohlins steering damper 
-Cycle Cat upper triple clamp 
-Cycle Cat rearsets
-BMC air filter 
-Harris upper/front fairing stay
-Motovation frame and rear axle sliders
-Rizoma brake fluid reservoirs 
-Carbon fiber exhaust shields
-SS brake lines
-LOW MILEAGE
-free set of tires.  Bridgestone BT002's

THE BAD:
-the only negative with this bike is it was lowsided at Thunderhill in turn 11.  It has a dent in the gas tank as a result, and some wear on the left side frame slider and air duct.  please see pics.  only cosmetic damage.


No lowballers.  No test rides without cash in hand and a valid M1.

A lot of bike for the money. Some cosmetic issues, paint scratches, dent in fuel tank. All due to minor low side. The bike is mechanically sound, a fantastic ride with great suspension, tons of power and great brakes. Year 2007, Yamaha corrected fuel injection mapping issues, throttle response is perfect. New brake pads, tires have plenty of tread, ( new Bridgestone rear tire, and set of spark plugs included). I am a 76 year old rider. The bike has been well maintained, no track days, never abused. Only selling because of spouse's  anxiety issues.
   Some extras: adjustable levers, GYTR carbon exhaust, tail cleanup, flush led turn signals, Yamaha comfy gel seat. Some riding apparel available.

  This bike is in Immaculate condition and runs well. It has 3,500 miles and is slowly climbing. There's only 150 produced for the US and this may be the the nicest one around in this color scheme. It's time to pass this beauty on for someone else to enjoy. The registration is current and it's ready to ride. I'm asking $9,000

May TRADE for another bike of equal value with low miles. Bikes of interest are BMW, Yamaha FZ1, Ducati Multistrada, kawasaki, Aprilia, Honda VFR Interceptor, looking for a good Two up Bike. Adventure bike.  I'm not interested in a project bike or any junk with issues.  

Ohlins, scotts, ducati, Yamaha, aprilia, Suzuki, Honda, Kawasaki.  Exotic.

I dont have to sell this bike, I love it, but I have too many vehicles, and too many projects, with too little time.
I ride this to work every few days, its got fresh gas, and has been ridden regularly. not sitting around.
Changed the oil last week, Plenty of tread on both tires, Rides and handles excellent!
Comes with the tank bag pictured, and some extra parts, my helmet, jacket, everything.
These bikes are known for magnets breaking loose on the crank magneto and I have a new replacement with gasket in case this happens. Custom USB port on dash with built in volt meter installed so you can monitor the charging voltage to know when this is starting.

If you want to test drive it, bring cash, while you are test riding it, Im holding your $3000. you crash it, you bought it.
Title is clean, 49 state bike, reg is current.

Price is firm, but partial trades will be considered.

Wonderful beast. I bought this bike immediately after hearing the engine start - the sound is fantastic. The adjustable shock (from 'S' model) is nice to have... I keep it stiff when riding solo and ease it up when adding a passenger.

First owner rode til about 18,000 miles, then I bought it in 2013 and rode to current mileage, which is around 41,500. She is still in great condition, though with the minor scuffs you'd expect. Garage parked, no accidents.

Mods:
- I installed the Givi top case, which is specifically the V47NT Tech Black 47 Litre Monokey model. It holds two full face helmets and is easy to remove from bike when not needed.
- Sargent seat and tinted touring screen put on by previous owner.
- Lights, bars, exhaust are all stock.

Maintenance has been regular and last service was done less than 2000 miles ago. Here are some recent replacements:
- Front and rear tires have less than 1500 miles, currently Angel GTs. Front fork seals replaced, rear brake pad replaced, and chain serviced at same time.
- Full annual service done about 9 months ago, including oil service, chain adjust, fluids check, and safety inspection.
- Battery is good and she starts quickly, usually after one or two turns of the engine.

I had Munroe do a Used Bike inspection report which I can share as well. It shows that all is well with the bike, esp. mechanically. A Vehicle History Report from VINCheckup.com is also available showing no accidents, liens, etc.

Most service done at Munroe, some at Desmoto. Registration good until early 2019.
Title in hand.

Up for sale is my 2012 BMW S1000RR. 
If you know how to work on bikes, don't miss out on this opportunity. As you can see the bike needs a few parts replaced but I've got a list of everything and it's going to be about $3000 to get it back in good shape.
This bike is an absolute BEAST ! Untouchable on the streets. It's a very rare color which was only made in 2012, its called fire blue. The bike has 24,xxx miles on it and still holds a clean title. This bike originally sold for $22,000. It's 200 HP at the rear wheel and 200 mph whenever you want it. The bike is dyno tuned with a Power Commander 5 and AERO exhaust . It's got Abs and traction control ! Also 4 different power settings accessible on the fly. (Slick)(rain)(Sport)(RACE) each unleash different levels of riders assists. It comes with Ohlins 10 way adjustable suspension & BREMBO brakes.
Most people dont know but this bike also comes with the electronic quick shift feature from the factory. (Sounds amazing when you're going through the gears)
·Motor and transmission are in tip top shape
The bike will come with everything you see including 
- Power commander 5
- Carbon Fiber AERO exhaust
- Fully adjustable VORTEX rear sets
- Adjustable levers
- Yoshimura license plate kit with LED light
- Brand New soft compound rear tire
- Brand new Galfer rear brakes

Here's what it needs

· Fork assembly $1350
· Front Intake assembly $25
· Headlight Bracket $45
· Front rim $230
· Rear rim $300
· Left side / front fairings $400
· Radiator $405
· Oil cooler $240

I have managed to find all the parts online. I just dont have time to work on the bike so I'm going to cut ties with it. My loss is your gain. There is money to be made on this thing. The motor alone is worth $2500. Transmission is worth another $2500. Even the gas tank is worth $1500


Im asking $2500 firm for the bike. After it's fixed this bike is worth over $9k so there's still plenty of room for profit. 
If interested call or text me at  show contact info

"Lean and capable, the Concours™ has meant sport-touring bliss for motorcycle fans. Its formula? A great sport-touring chassis, muscular 997cc Ninja®-inspired In-line Four engine, big 7.5-gallon fuel tank and detachable hard bags. Steer the Concours up a winding touring road just once, and you'll wish you had discovered it earlier.

When it comes to sport-touring, it doesn't get much better than the Kawasaki Concours™ motorcycle. The bike is equipped with a sportbike-style fairing that offers ample wind protection, and hard saddlebags for loads of carrying capacity, and there's the added benefit of the Concours™ power and handling ability that is on par with the NINJA® sportbikes. The Kawasaki Concours is equally ideal for long-distance adventure and daily commuting alike"

Hey everyone!

Up for sale is my Aprilia Tuono, it's the half year so there's some slight power gain and different front brakes.

History:
As far as I know, I'm the second owner, previous owner downed it, I replaced all necessary parts to get it in running condition but there are still some scratches on the bike but they are minor.

I removed some of the decals due to it being faded and I just haven't gotten around to buying a new set to replace them.

Title is clean.
Current Miles: 15,xxx

Parts Replaced:
Air Duct
Left Headlight

Services:
-I have service records which includes a valve adjustment which I did myself. I'll be more than happy to provide all proof of documentation as request! 
-Most recent service was an oil change and changing out the rear brake pads along with re-bleeding it. 06/30/18

Misc:
-Leo Vince Slip ons (Will include stock exhaust)
-Metzler Roadtech Z8 tires
-New Battery (Replaced as of 06/30/18)
-EK MVXZ2 Series 520 Chain
-Driven Race sprockets 15 tooth front/ 40 tooth rear 

Price: Looking for $4800 OBO! 
Preferably no trades, but only trade I would consider is a KTM 390 Duke
Thanks!

Ducati ST4S, like new condition 16,000 miles. I know the history from the first owner (from Palo Alto area) and I do have original red key, red code number, and extra key. It was just tuned up, valves etc. and all the services are up to date. Services were done at Nichol's and Advanced Cysle Service. It just got new tires, new brake pads, new front shocks (there was an oil leak), new chain. It has a lot of extras:

- Sergant leather seat (+ original seat)
- Bar risers
- Throttle lock
- Two extra windshields (+ original Ducati)
- camera installed
- extra power outlets
- Frame sliders
- Front axle sliders
- Givi monolock top case
- Side mirrors with integrated signals (+ original ones)

There are no scratches nor dents. There is only a very small crack at the side frame at the screw, hardly visible (shown in pictures)

This is a fast bike 117hp, fun and sporty but comfortable for a long ride. A true sport touring bike. They do not make it any longer and this was the best Ducati model in this category.

Why am I selling it? I am getting too old to ride. It is risky.  This is a crazy good deal on this bike. Don't be fooled by the low price. It's an awesome deal and an awesome bike, with pedigre.

Cash and your valid M1 license in my hand, if you want a test drive. Serious inquires only. No tire kickers. No asking what is my lowest price. It is what you see. No offerings for MotoFax, I know the trick.

2005 Kawasaki Concours ZG1000

4 cylinder engine, liquid cooled, disk brakes (dual in front).  There are tons of sites online with information about this bike and specs if you want to check them out.

I bought this from the original owner back in 2011.  It's a great bike.  Although I never thought I would sell this bike, I simply do not ride anymore and need to be practical.  This bike is amazingly reliable - in my 7 years of ownership, I don't think I have done anything but maintenance type work (nothing breaks).

Bike just had the carburetor taken apart and cleaned and got a clean bill of health.  Runs very well and so much fun to drive.  The bike is very comfortable and great for long road trips which is primarily what the first owner and I used it for (thus the included accessories outlined below).  

Aftermarket accessories included (installed on bike):
1) Givi trunk
2) Handlebar risers (allow you to position yourself a little more straight up (rather than forward) - must for long rides)
3) Throttle lock (for a cruise control-like experience) and matching end cap for other handlebar
4) 12V cigarette lighter adapter in dash
5) Aux power lead to battery (to connect battery tender or battery powered bike suit)

First pic is stock, the others are recent pics of the actual bike.  While not shown in all the pics, the side bags come with the bike.

A lot of bike for the money. Some cosmetic issues, paint scratches, dent in fuel tank. All due to minor low side. The bike is mechanically sound, a fantastic ride with great suspension, tons of power and great brakes. Year 2007, Yamaha corrected fuel injection mapping issues, throttle response is perfect. New brake pads, tires have plenty of tread, ( new Bridgestone rear tire, and set of spark plugs included). I am a 76 year old rider. The bike has been well maintained, no track days, never abused. Only selling because of spouse's  anxiety issues.
   Some extras: adjustable levers, GYTR carbon exhaust, tail cleanup, flush led turn signals, Yamaha comfy gel seat. Some riding apparel available.

  This bike is in Immaculate condition and runs well. It has 3,500 miles and is slowly climbing. There's only 150 produced for the US and this may be the the nicest one around in this color scheme. It's time to pass this beauty on for someone else to enjoy. The registration is current and it's ready to ride. I'm asking $9,000

May TRADE for another bike of equal value with low miles. Bikes of interest are BMW, Yamaha FZ1, Ducati Multistrada, kawasaki, Aprilia, Honda VFR Interceptor, looking for a good Two up Bike. Adventure bike.  I'm not interested in a project bike or any junk with issues.

Wonderful beast. I bought this bike immediately after hearing the engine start - the sound is fantastic. The adjustable shock (from 'S' model) is nice to have... I keep it stiff when riding solo and ease it up when adding a passenger.

First owner rode til about 18,000 miles, then I bought it in 2013 and rode to current mileage, which is around 41,500. She is still in great condition, though with the minor scuffs you'd expect. Garage parked, no accidents.

Mods:
- I installed the Givi top case, which is specifically the V47NT Tech Black 47 Litre Monokey model. It holds two full face helmets and is easy to remove from bike when not needed.
- Sargent seat and tinted touring screen put on by previous owner.
- Lights, bars, exhaust are all stock.

Maintenance has been regular and last service was done less than 2000 miles ago. Here are some recent replacements:
- Front and rear tires have less than 1500 miles, currently Angel GTs. Front fork seals replaced, rear brake pad replaced, and chain serviced at same time.
- Full annual service done about 9 months ago, including oil service, chain adjust, fluids check, and safety inspection.
- Battery is good and she starts quickly, usually after one or two turns of the engine.

I had Munroe do a Used Bike inspection report which I can share as well. It shows that all is well with the bike, esp. mechanically. A Vehicle History Report from VINCheckup.com is also available showing no accidents, liens, etc.

Most service done at Munroe, some at Desmoto. Registration good until early 2019.
Title in hand.

Up for sale is my 2012 BMW S1000RR. 
If you know how to work on bikes, don't miss out on this opportunity. As you can see the bike needs a few parts replaced but I've got a list of everything and it's going to be about $3000 to get it back in good shape.
This bike is an absolute BEAST ! Untouchable on the streets. It's a very rare color which was only made in 2012, its called fire blue. The bike has 24,xxx miles on it and still holds a clean title. This bike originally sold for $22,000. It's 200 HP at the rear wheel and 200 mph whenever you want it. The bike is dyno tuned with a Power Commander 5 and AERO exhaust . It's got Abs and traction control ! Also 4 different power settings accessible on the fly. (Slick)(rain)(Sport)(RACE) each unleash different levels of riders assists. It comes with Ohlins 10 way adjustable suspension & BREMBO brakes.
Most people dont know but this bike also comes with the electronic quick shift feature from the factory. (Sounds amazing when you're going through the gears)
·Motor and transmission are in tip top shape
The bike will come with everything you see including 
- Power commander 5
- Carbon Fiber AERO exhaust
- Fully adjustable VORTEX rear sets
- Adjustable levers
- Yoshimura license plate kit with LED light
- Brand New soft compound rear tire
- Brand new Galfer rear brakes

Here's what it needs

· Fork assembly $1350
· Front Intake assembly $25
· Headlight Bracket $45
· Front rim $230
· Rear rim $300
· Left side / front fairings $400
· Radiator $405
· Oil cooler $240

I have managed to find all the parts online. I just dont have time to work on the bike so I'm going to cut ties with it. My loss is your gain. There is money to be made on this thing. The motor alone is worth $2500. Transmission is worth another $2500. Even the gas tank is worth $1500


Im asking $2500 firm for the bike. After it's fixed this bike is worth over $9k so there's still plenty of room for profit. 
If interested call or text me at  show contact info

"Lean and capable, the Concours™ has meant sport-touring bliss for motorcycle fans. Its formula? A great sport-touring chassis, muscular 997cc Ninja®-inspired In-line Four engine, big 7.5-gallon fuel tank and detachable hard bags. Steer the Concours up a winding touring road just once, and you'll wish you had discovered it earlier.

When it comes to sport-touring, it doesn't get much better than the Kawasaki Concours™ motorcycle. The bike is equipped with a sportbike-style fairing that offers ample wind protection, and hard saddlebags for loads of carrying capacity, and there's the added benefit of the Concours™ power and handling ability that is on par with the NINJA® sportbikes. The Kawasaki Concours is equally ideal for long-distance adventure and daily commuting alike"

Hey everyone!

As far as I know, I'm the second owner, previous owner downed it, I replaced all necessary parts to get it in running condition but there are still some scratches on the bike but they are minor.

Title is clean.
Current Miles: 15,xxx

Parts Replaced:
Air Duct
Left Headlight

Services:
-I have service records which includes a valve adjustment which I did myself. I'll be more than happy to provide all proof of documentation as request! 
-Most recent service was an oil change and changing out the rear brake pads along with re-bleeding it. 06/30/18

Misc:
-Leo Vince Slip ons (Will include stock exhaust)
-Metzler Roadtech Z8 tires
-New Battery (Replaced as of 06/30/18)
-EK MVXZ2 Series 520 Chain

Ducati ST4S, like new condition 16,000 miles. I know the history from the first owner (from Palo Alto area) and I do have original red key, red code number, and extra key. It was just tuned up, valves etc. and all the services are up to date. Services were done at Nichol's and Advanced Cysle Service. It just got new tires, new brake pads, new front shocks (there was an oil leak), new chain. It has a lot of extras:

- Sergant leather seat (+ original seat)
- Bar risers
- Throttle lock
- Two extra windshields (+ original Ducati)
- camera installed
- extra power outlets
- Frame sliders
- Front axle sliders
- Givi monolock top case
- Side mirrors with integrated signals (+ original ones)

There are no scratches nor dents. There is only a very small crack at the side frame at the screw, hardly visible (shown in pictures)

This is a fast bike 117hp, fun and sporty but comfortable for a long ride. A true sport touring bike. They do not make it any longer and this was the best Ducati model in this category.

Why am I selling it? I am getting too old to ride. It is risky.  This is a crazy good deal on this bike. Don't be fooled by the low price. It's an awesome deal and an awesome bike, with pedigre.

Cash and your valid M1 license in my hand, if you want a test drive. Serious inquires only. No tire kickers. No asking what is my lowest price. It is what you see. No offerings for MotoFax, I know the trick.

2005 Kawasaki Concours ZG1000

4 cylinder engine, liquid cooled, disk brakes (dual in front).  There are tons of sites online with information about this bike and specs if you want to check them out.

I bought this from the original owner back in 2011.  It's a great bike.  Although I never thought I would sell this bike, I simply do not ride anymore and need to be practical.  This bike is amazingly reliable - in my 7 years of ownership, I don't think I have done anything but maintenance type work (nothing breaks).

Bike just had the carburetor taken apart and cleaned and got a clean bill of health.  Runs very well and so much fun to drive.  The bike is very comfortable and great for long road trips which is primarily what the first owner and I used it for (thus the included accessories outlined below).  

Aftermarket accessories included (installed on bike):
1) Givi trunk
2) Handlebar risers (allow you to position yourself a little more straight up (rather than forward) - must for long rides)
3) Throttle lock (for a cruise control-like experience) and matching end cap for other handlebar
4) 12V cigarette lighter adapter in dash
5) Aux power lead to battery (to connect battery tender or battery powered bike suit)

First pic is stock, the others are recent pics of the actual bike.  While not shown in all the pics, the side bags come with the bike.

Runs very good. It  is almost new. Come check it out. Had previously posted this as 2012.  That was when it was first sold.  Its 2008

For sale is my 2008 cbr 1000rr. Was my daily rider for a year and a half. From the first owner I got it from at 5k miles. I took it to the mechanic because I heard a rattling one day. They told me it was fine sand into the engine through the airbox and it'll need a new engine unfortunately. This bike was really fun and I hate to sell it like this, but I had already planned on using this bike as a downpayment on another bike and now plans have changed. All services were done on the bike. All parts work and bike still runs (mechanic said rattling will get louder the more its ridden) since everything else works that's why I am starting at a high asking price. I had also recently put new brakes and had new fork seals put onto the bike no more than 3000 miles ago. 

Someone who's willing to replace the engine will have a really fun bike on their hands. Will add pictures when possible.

Mods:

Two brothers exhaust with midpipe and fender eliminator kit (previous owner)

520 chain conversion ~5000 miles ago

Pirelli Angel GT tires ~50% tread

Aftermarket levers

Priced $1000 below KBB for quick sale.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll wait until Spring and relist at MSRP.

This GSXR1000 has a Clean California Title on hand, original matching key & spare, current registration, starts right up, the 6-speed high-compression race engine revs cleanly and smoothly (please let her warm up first) and shifts perfectly. She's FULLY serviced and will require no supplementary costs to be road worthy.

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Thanks,
Jake

The bike is $2400 because there is a ticking noise and I don't have the money to chase this issue and pay for it.
I put all my love into this bike and I'm sad to have to get rid of it for college.
This bike has had maintenance whenever it needed it.
Below is a list of important factors about this bike:
Brand new cam chain tensioner, oil, and oil filter. I rode the bike home 2 miles and haven't rode it since the shop did this.
Brand new clutch cable replaced after it broke.
The entire front triple tree was ripped out and replaced.
Relatively new front and bike Michelin Road 5 tires.
Brand new front rotors.
Upgraded suspension.
Adjustable brake lever.
Upgraded sprocket (2 teeth down in the front, 3 teeth up in the back).

I'm sure there's more I'm leaving out, but contact me if you have any questions about the bike.

2005 Kawasaki Concours - ZG1000

$1300

Hello Everyone, 

I'm selling my 2005 Kawasaki Concours, ZG 1000. 

I love this bike, but I need to sell it. It has one main issue which is why I'm selling for $1300 OBO. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY! Issue listed below.

Like most sport-touring models, this bike has a comfortable seat and is a nice ride with good acceleration. The bike has about 25k miles on it. I've kept and maintained it since I've owned it over the past 2-3 years. I've worked on it myself, but have also taken it in to be serviced at a dealer. 

This bike is great for commuting; It used to be my daily driver for my commute to school and work. I could pack all I needed for the day in my saddle bags and on the luggage rack. The ride is comfortable and still has power when you need it. 

Cosmetic/ Accessories:
1. (2) front pockets 
2. Speakers with AUX cable in front-left pocket
3. 12V receptacle; works with car charger adapters, I use it to charge my phone or iPod when I have my music going.
4. (2) hard-shelled saddle bags
5. Handle bar throttle-lock cruise control
6. Passenger back-rest
7. Small luggage rack base
8. I'm including the recently bought hex-head bolts to replace most of the factory installed ones and the service manual


Maintenance:
1. Recent oil/filter change (About 3 months ago)
2. Coolant flush/replacement
3. Rebuilt master/slave clutch cylinders
4. New front brake pads
5. New rear brake pads (need to be installed)
6. Cleaned out the carburetors when I first bought it
7. Fairly new tires with plenty of tread left

Needs work:
1. The acceleration isn't always there. From the feel of the throttle, it may need to have the clutch disks replaced. (This is why I am selling it; as a student and being recently engaged I can't put any money in to the bike)
2. small oil drip at the oil pan bolt; bought a new washer to be installed, but I haven't installed it because I wanted to buy a magnetic oil pan bolt.
3. Some scratches on the fairings; cracked plastics near the right turn signal.
4. Cracked left mirror

Besides these things, everything works fine. 

NOTE: THE BIKE RUNS AND RIDES, BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND A WAY TO TRANSPORT IT AS PER THE ISSUE LISTED ABOVE

If all this sounds good to you, feel free to email or send a text to (nine zero nine) two six zero - eight six two five AGAIN, ONLY SERIOUS INQUIRES! I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME. I AM OFTEN BUSY FROM 6:30AM-8PM WEEKDAYS SO WEEKENDS ARE THE BEST TIME TO LOOK AT THE BIKE. I will respond more quickly to text, so text is preferred!

2003 Cagiva V-Raptor

2003 CAGIVA RAPTOR a/k/a Ducati Monster 2: very rare, excellent shape!

$2899

QR Code Link to This Post


Up for sale is my 2003 Cagiva V-Raptor 1000. This model started the "praying mantis" style semi-naked bikes. I think its one of the most unique looking bikes in recent years. It's also rare: I believe there are only about 5 Cagiva Raptors in the U.S., and that this is the only V-Raptor model in the country.

History: the Cagiva Raptor was intended to be an alternative to the Ducati Monster and it was designed by the same man who penned the Monster (Galuzzi designed both since Ducati & Cagiva used to be sister companies). While the Monster has an expensive to repair and sometimes tempermental Ducati motor, Cagiva sourced a more powerful 1000 CC V-twin motor from Suzuki - the same motor as Suzuki used in their legendry 1000TL (known as a very fast bike).

Cagiva says the Suzuki motor makes about 112 HP in the V-Raptor - a lot for a bike this light. Best of all: the Suzuki motor is proven, reliable, is not expensive to get parts for if needed, and can be serviced or repaired at just about any motorcycle mechanic or Suzuki dealership. And it is the same motor as used in the Bimota SB8R. 

I bought this bike about a year ago. Since buying it, I had the tank and fairings painted matte white (painter did a good job, not perfect -- but it looks very cool). I installed a different set of bars ("Driven" brand - wider than what it came with for greater comfort). I instaled new mini mirrors and grips. I replaced the headlight bulb with a Silverstar Ultra High Performace bulb and the driving light bulb with an LED bulb.

I also relaced the pipes it came with with a brand new set of Ducati 1088 pipes. I changed the front brake reservoir, changed the brake fluid and bled front and rear brakes. I put in a new battery and clutch cable. I had the radiator pressure tested and flushed and replaced the coolant. I did an oil and filter change and changed the spark plugs (NGK). It has a pretty fresh set of matched expensive Michellin tires. 

Everything that looks like carbon fiber on the bike actually is (except the carbon looking "Cagiva" protective sticker on the engine cover). A prior owner replaced the front fender, the tank "cowls" & the side covers with real carbon parts. The tank, upper fairing and lower fairing are a PVC material material, the rear fender has been deleted, etc....not a lot of fat on this bike. The rear pillion is removeable and there is a passenger seat.

I have been wanting to get the correct front turn signals that fit in the openings in the fairing: the ones on now will work fine, but I haven't wired them up yet. I have also been looking for a new wind screen - this one has been painted matte black and looks good, but it has damage noticeable on inspection. I noticed a drop of oil under the bike last week - I did not change the crush washer when I did the oil change so that may be it.

Starts easy. Runs and shifts well. Does not smoke. All lights and horn work. 
Comes with original pipes, original bars, original mirrors, original "cowl", a box of extras and spares, etc...
48K Miles. Has valid California registration with no back due fees or penalties and a clean title in my name.

Other bikes of this generation (Italian and japanese) will just go down in value - this  one will hold and appreciate due to rarity.
$2,899

***NO SCAMMERS - I will report you. Also, I DO NOT need help selling this motorcycle*** 

Thanks...

Priced $1000 under KBB to sell fast.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll be waiting until Spring and reposting for actual MSRP.

This GSX-R goes 300kph. 190mph. This thing is F.A.S.T. and priced right if you're willing to get into that seat in the budget trim. This bike has more upgrades than I can even list. I will include F.R.E.E. extras in the sale whichever level you choose (see below)~

Clean Title. Current Registration. Starts right up. Fully Serviced. No problems. Needs Nothing. Low Miles. Ready to Canyon, Commute, or Careen at the Track.

This GSXR has Power Modes which literally turn the bike into a 600, 750, or the full 1000 beast. Push of a button, takes 2 seconds.  It's a very cool option for tight technical canyons or close-quarter lane-splitting.

Option 1: As pictured, with those $$$ Carrozzeria Wheels, Brembo Brakes, and many more goodies not seen: $7500
Option 2: Stock Wheels & Brakes, Full Two Bros Black Series & Mystery Door #2 goodies: $5500
Option 3: Don't upsale me with wheels and flashy name-brand stuff, the stock version is fast enough! $5000

Free Delivery, Just detailed the bike, or bring your pessimistic mechanic and lift her skirt in person~

Never been able to use this line when selling one of my bikes...

Accident forces sale. Or to be more accurate - some asshole without insurance or a driver's licence hit me on my way to work and jacked up my shoulder and a year of my life.... I can't ride for another several months. Bike to good home.

2011 Honda CB1000R. 
Registered.
Clear title in hand.
I'm the second owner. Previous owner worked for American Honda, so the bike was taken care of prior to my taking possession.
28900 well cared for miles.
I purchased the bike with 12000miles on the odo. 
I've used this bike for commuting only.  No track days. Hadn't even gotten a chance to hang it out in the canyons...
4.2 gallon gas tank and I can reliably get 140miles/tank exceeding the speed limit at all times. Naked bike, no fairing = great gas mileage is what i'm saying.

Bike is buttery smooth as to be expected for a well sorted Honda inline 4. 
Arkapovic titanium muffler with carbon fiber endcap and actual mid-pipe! True 4 into 1. Not loud, no gimmicky sounding bullshit eBay exhaust. 
Power commander to manage fuel, runs great at all rpm and all angles.....
Fabbri windscreen not installed. It works. I took it off for the photos.
New Michelin Pilot Road 5 tires front and rear - not even scrubbed in yet.

As I alluded to up top. I was hit on the 405 back in May. My body took the brunt of the low speed impact. I'm still recovering from shoulder surgery. The bike was knocked out from under me.
Clutch cover was scraped. Right handlebar was scraped. Right mirror was scrapped. That's it! Bike ran when picked up. Too bad I wasn't in running condition after.
Anyway...New bars, bar ends, grips, mirrors, clutch cover, clutch cover bolts and the bike looks just as good as it did before that shithead hit me. I'm not bitter. Not at all....

You can have the take off parts if you want them. 
Not trying to hide anything. Bike runs great. 
Test ride if you have cash in hand or leave me the keys to your truck.....and a motorcycle endorsement on your license. That's actually a deal breaker for me. Go figure. Bring a helmet too because you can't borrow mine. That's just gross. And weird.

Email me your cell number, I'll text you back and you can check it out.

Great bike. I'm retired and having neck surgery so my riding days are done. Time for an RV. Only owner and only rider. Many extra's including Power Commander 5, Two Bros Pipes, Center Stand, Factory Gel Seat, Givi 43 liter top box w/ Givi mounting gear, Givi engine guards, Madstad Bracket w/ Givi tall windscreen, Battery Tender Jr and cords and for an extra $50 I'll include a pair of fleece lined Hippo Hands which are priceless in colder weather. Oh and it has heated grips as well. Cash only and I mean currency. No checks. It has been a great commuter for me and a great bike for canyons and coastal routes. It has started every time I pressed the starter without fail. I've worked in a bike shop for the last 13 years that has Suzuki as one of it's lines so you can count on it being very well maintained. Never more than 3500 between oil changes. Only Motul 5100 in the engine. Serious people only please. KBB excellent condition is $4500 but I know the miles are a bit high for some so hence the lower price. Tires are also in good shape. Michelin Pilot Road 3's with easily 10k left. I also have a spare air filter and brake pads that I'm including.
Just renewed plates. Be happy to go to AAA with you to insure smooth transfer. Please email if you have questions or would like to come and see it.
Also will include a lot of riding gear if you're a large guy like me, 6'2...250... Jackets, gloves cold pants and cold weather riding suit. Bout $1000+ of gear...

Hello CL, up for sale is this fuel injected 1000cc torque monster! 
   This bike is tastefully modified and has been adult owened and never stunted or abused. Completely updated suspension from a zx10 with the large radial mounted brakes for better stopping power rounding off the braking is a brembo RSC 19 master cylinder with steel braided brake lines with EBC HH brake pads to better clamp the rotors. Fenomenal stopping power!
Outback is the Zx10 rear shock for better handling, Dunlop q3's for better cornering. New chain kit with one tooth up outback along with a custom machined flywheel for great acceleration new Barnett clutch and clutch cable for smooth action. Rounding off the power is a FULL TITANIUM PIPE made by Mr. Kawasaki Rob "Muzzy" power commander K&N air. Filter with a custom modified air box for better air flow. That's just on tap, regularly maintained with primium motorcycle specific fluids including primium gasoline. 
   This bike is solid and very reliable.  Unfortunately the previous owner lowsided it at low speed so there is a small flat spot on the tank and road rash on the fairing it's only cosmetic flaws that does not affect the performance. I purchased this bike completely stock and modified it to my liking, those that know about motorcycles and motorcycle performance can see and appreciate the modifications. The seating position on this bike is very comfortable almost dirt bike like therefore splitting lanes on the gridlocked freeways is easy peasy! Plus the pipe sounds loud enough to warn motorists. NOW That said, serious buyers only CASH ONLY! Scammers will be ignored no trades CASH ONLY! No payments CASH ONLY! No shipping COD ONLY! NO Military shipping of any kind CASH ONLY!

I have for sale a 2008 R1 with 28,198 miles. Valve adjustment has been done already so you don't have to worry about that. It runs great, feels great, looks great!

Pro's : Oil changes always on time along with the 25,000 mile maintenance done at RPM Cycles whom also did the valve adjustment. Decent thread on tires and an all around well taken care of motorcycle. Most of the miles were freeway miles from Ventura to Fillmore commute and therefore it has a Pirelli Angel tire in the back. Bike has never been down under my ownership, past owner did scratch it by running into a yellow pole. Galfer ceramic brakes with less that 5k miles on them. 

Con's : Ignition coil #1 is under spec for resistance, I am currently looking for the part which runs $100. Front lights High beams and regulars are out, the previous owner installed after market lights and because I never really rode at night I never found it necessary to look into it. Chain will eventually need to be replaced.

Not a con but oil change is coming up @ 30,000 miles. 

If you are looking for a fun, powerful and sick looking bike than you don't have to look anywhere else. If you are mechanically inclined you can I can knock down $200 that the ignition coil + labor would cost you to replace. 

I can include my Shoei GT Air Helmet which to be honest it might be good as a spare but the visor is pretty scratched as well as my Scorpion Phantom Jacket which I got when I purchased the bike so it has some good miles on it. I am 6'4 and weigh 210. 

Give me a text or email me if you have any questions,

QR Code Link to This Post


I'm selling my 2003 Yamaha FZ-1. It runs good and is very reliable and it's a very fast bike. It has the same engine as the R1 race bike, except Yamaha de-tuned it a bit so it's better for touring. It's one of the most comfortable bikes I've ever owned. I can't ride crotch rockets for very long so this is the next best thing. Great for long rides and it handles great. I'm only selling because I will be moving out of state in a few months and don't want to move it. It has several upgrades from the previous owner as well as some scratches on the side from when he went down at about 10mph. It doesn't effect the bike in any way other than looks. The engine has aftermarket crash guards so there is no engine damage, it just pushed the bars into the tank on one side and cracked the front fairing. I would be willing to trade or partial trade on a trailer for when I move, other than that cash only, and cash in my hand before you even think about riding it, sorry no exceptions, this bike is too fast. Call Tony at 847 nine eight seven 000 three

The upgrades on this bike alone were well over $1500. This has the extremely rare (impossible to find) multi-gauge that replaced the stock fuel gauge with an integrated display that tells, gear position, fuel, speed, temp, etc.

Aftermarket upgrades: 
Sargent Seat $300+  - Extremely more comfort for long rides
Penske Racing rear shock $500+ - fully adjustable
Engine guards $85
Multi-gauge display, was $500 installed - impossible to find, when you can, people still pay $300 for them
Yoshimura Pipe $400 - Sounds sweet
Pirelli Angel GT tires $300 - these are the absolute best tire for a sport-touring bike, I'll never use another tire.

Priced $1000 under KBB for quick sale.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll wait until Spring and relist at MSRP.  

Clean Title on Hand, Current Registration, Starts Right Up, Idles Perfect, Revs Perfect, Shifts Perfect, Original Suzuki Key, and can be ridden home or straight to the canyons~

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.  Learn about it here even if you don't want the bike! https://www.superstreetbike.com/gsx-r1000-in-full-power-mode-can-you-turn-1000-into-600-mythbusters

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Bring your pessimistic mechanic friend and lift her skirt, take her for a test ride, and bring your magnifying glass. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Thanks,
Jake

Hi CL, I'm selling my 2005 FZ1. Broke my leg badly (not riding) and required surgery. Can't ride for 6+ months, and I need the money to pay for the surgery. The bike has been 100% garage kept and responsibly ridden (daily) as a commuter bike. Clean title, registration through May 2019.

- Maintenance within last 3 weeks 
- New Michelin Pilot Road Sport 4 front tire ($140)
- Back tire same model, 70% tread left
New battery ($110)
Oil Change/Filter ($45)
Carb clean and Sync ($200)
Spark Plugs (4 x $5)
Chain Lube (Only half a tank ridden since)

- Specs -
Size: 998cc
Horsepower: 120
MPG: 40-45
Tank Size: 4 gallons
Rear tire: 180
Front tire: 120

Shortened Exhaust (Not obnoxiously loud, but a sexy loud)

The only thing the bike will need in the near future is a new chain (sprocket is ok). Bike starts and runs beautifully regardless of weather or sit time. I love this bike and don't want to sell it, so I want to make sure she goes to a good home. Open to partial trades but need the cash more than anything.

For Sale: Suzuki DL1000 V-Strom

Was a daily but got a new job further away.  I will be moving so my baby has to find a new home. This is a very fun bike and commuting to work I always had a smile on my face.  I also used to ride to Orange county and back on the weekends which is where most of the miles came from.

The Good:
Givi windscreen with adjustable mount
New Battery
Throttle lock (this should be a must for every bike)
Just paid registration, just need sticker for 11/2019
Cheap/removable top case

The bad: 
1. Seat starting to crack and a large crack has developed on the right side.  I would recommend a more comfortable seat anyway, my regret is not buying one.
2. Dusty.   Needs a wash.  Pictures show current state except one from when it was clean.
3. Right side of topcase scratched up.  This is from when I used to park in a garage to make room to walk through.


No trades or tattoos or other offers. Cash only.  Prefer initial email communication.
I work out of town during the week so viewing will need to be on the weekends

2005 Kawasaki Concours - ZG1000

$1300

Hello Everyone, 

I'm selling my 2005 Kawasaki Concours, ZG 1000. 

I love this bike, but I need to sell it. It has one main issue which is why I'm selling for $1300 OBO. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY! Issue listed below.

Like most sport-touring models, this bike has a comfortable seat and is a nice ride with good acceleration. The bike has about 25k miles on it. I've kept and maintained it since I've owned it over the past 2-3 years. I've worked on it myself, but have also taken it in to be serviced at a dealer. 

This bike is great for commuting; It used to be my daily driver for my commute to school and work. I could pack all I needed for the day in my saddle bags and on the luggage rack. The ride is comfortable and still has power when you need it. 

Cosmetic/ Accessories:
1. (2) front pockets 
2. Speakers with AUX cable in front-left pocket
3. 12V receptacle; works with car charger adapters, I use it to charge my phone or iPod when I have my music going.
4. (2) hard-shelled saddle bags
5. Handle bar throttle-lock cruise control
6. Passenger back-rest
7. Small luggage rack base
8. I'm including the recently bought hex-head bolts to replace most of the factory installed ones and the service manual


Maintenance:
1. Recent oil/filter change (About 3 months ago)
2. Coolant flush/replacement
3. Rebuilt master/slave clutch cylinders
4. New front brake pads
5. New rear brake pads (need to be installed)
6. Cleaned out the carburetors when I first bought it
7. Fairly new tires with plenty of tread left

Needs work:
1. The acceleration isn't always there. From the feel of the throttle, it may need to have the clutch disks replaced. (This is why I am selling it; as a student and being recently engaged I can't put any money in to the bike)
2. small oil drip at the oil pan bolt; bought a new washer to be installed, but I haven't installed it because I wanted to buy a magnetic oil pan bolt.
3. Some scratches on the fairings; cracked plastics near the right turn signal.
4. Cracked left mirror

Besides these things, everything works fine. 

NOTE: THE BIKE RUNS AND RIDES, BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND A WAY TO TRANSPORT IT AS PER THE ISSUE LISTED ABOVE

If all this sounds good to you, feel free to email or send a text to (nine zero nine) two six zero - eight six two five AGAIN, ONLY SERIOUS INQUIRES! I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME. I AM OFTEN BUSY FROM 6:30AM-8PM WEEKDAYS SO WEEKENDS ARE THE BEST TIME TO LOOK AT THE BIKE. I will respond more quickly to text, so text is preferred!

For sale is my 2008 cbr 1000rr. Was my daily rider for a year and a half. From the first owner I got it from at 5k miles. I took it to the mechanic because I heard a rattling one day. They told me it was fine sand into the engine through the airbox and it'll need a new engine unfortunately. This bike was really fun and I hate to sell it like this, but I had already planned on using this bike as a downpayment on another bike and now plans have changed. All services were done on the bike. All parts work and bike still runs (mechanic said rattling will get louder the more its ridden) since everything else works that's why I am starting at a high asking price. I had also recently put new brakes and had new fork seals put onto the bike no more than 3000 miles ago. 

Someone who's willing to replace the engine will have a really fun bike on their hands. Will add pictures when possible.

Mods:

Two brothers exhaust with midpipe and fender eliminator kit (previous owner)

520 chain conversion ~5000 miles ago

Pirelli Angel GT tires ~50% tread

Aftermarket levers

Priced $1000 below KBB for quick sale.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll wait until Spring and relist at MSRP.

This GSXR1000 has a Clean California Title on hand, original matching key & spare, current registration, starts right up, the 6-speed high-compression race engine revs cleanly and smoothly (please let her warm up first) and shifts perfectly. She's FULLY serviced and will require no supplementary costs to be road worthy.

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Clean Title
Willing to negiotiate
The bike is $2400 because there is a ticking noise and I don't have the money to chase this issue and pay for it.
I put all my love into this bike and I'm sad to have to get rid of it for college.
This bike has had maintenance whenever it needed it.
Below is a list of important factors about this bike:
Brand new cam chain tensioner, oil, and oil filter. I rode the bike home 2 miles and haven't rode it since the shop did this.
Brand new clutch cable replaced after it broke.
The entire front triple tree was ripped out and replaced.
Relatively new front and bike Michelin Road 5 tires.
Brand new front rotors.
Upgraded suspension.
Adjustable brake lever.
Upgraded sprocket (2 teeth down in the front, 3 teeth up in the back).

I'm sure there's more I'm leaving out, but contact me if you have any questions about the bike.

I'm selling my 2003 Yamaha FZ-1. It runs good and is very reliable and it's a very fast bike. It has the same engine as the R1 race bike, except Yamaha de-tuned it a bit so it's better for touring. It's one of the most comfortable bikes I've ever owned. I can't ride crotch rockets for very long so this is the next best thing. Great for long rides and it handles great. I'm only selling because I will be moving out of state in a few months and don't want to move it. It has several upgrades from the previous owner as well as some scratches on the side from when he went down at about 10mph. It doesn't effect the bike in any way other than looks. The engine has aftermarket crash guards so there is no engine damage, it just pushed the bars into the tank on one side and cracked the front fairing. I would be willing to trade or partial trade on a trailer for when I move, other than that cash only, and cash in my hand before you even think about riding it, sorry no exceptions, this bike is too fast. Call Tony at 847 nine eight seven 000 three

The upgrades on this bike alone were well over $1500. This has the extremely rare (impossible to find) multi-gauge that replaced the stock fuel gauge with an integrated display that tells, gear position, fuel, speed, temp, etc.

Aftermarket upgrades: 
Sargent Seat $300+  - Extremely more comfort for long rides
Penske Racing rear shock $500+ - fully adjustable
Engine guards $85
Multi-gauge display, was $500 installed - impossible to find, when you can, people still pay $300 for them
Yoshimura Pipe $400 - Sounds sweet
Pirelli Angel GT tires $300 - these are the absolute best tire for a sport-touring bike, I'll never use another tire.

Hi CL, I'm selling my 2005 FZ1. Broke my leg badly (not riding) and required surgery. Can't ride for 6+ months, and I need the money to pay for the surgery. The bike has been 100% garage kept and responsibly ridden (daily) as a commuter bike. Clean title, registration through May 2019.

- New Michelin Pilot Road Sport 4 front tire ($140)
- Back tire same model, 70% tread left
New battery ($110)

Carb clean and Sync ($200)
Spark Plugs (4 x $5)
Chain Lube (Only half a tank ridden since)

Size: 998cc
Horsepower: 120
MPG: 40-45
Tank Size: 4 gallons

The only thing the bike will need in the near future is a new chain (sprocket is ok). Bike starts and runs beautifully regardless of weather or sit time.

For Sale: Suzuki DL1000 V-Strom

Was a daily but got a new job further away.  I will be moving so my baby has to find a new home. This is a very fun bike and commuting to work I always had a smile on my face.  I also used to ride to Orange county and back on the weekends which is where most of the miles came from.

The Good:
Givi windscreen with adjustable mount
New Battery
Throttle lock (this should be a must for every bike)
Just paid registration, just need sticker for 11/2019
Cheap/removable top case

The bad: 
1. Seat starting to crack and a large crack has developed on the right side.  I would recommend a more comfortable seat anyway, my regret is not buying one.
2. Dusty.   Needs a wash.  Pictures show current state except one from when it was clean.
3. Right side of topcase scratched up.  This is from when I used to park in a garage to make room to walk through.


No trades or tattoos or other offers. Cash only.  Prefer initial email communication.
I work out of town during the week so viewing will need to be on the weekends

2003 CAGIVA RAPTOR a/k/a Ducati Monster 2: very rare, excellent shape!

$2899

QR Code Link to This Post


Up for sale is my 2003 Cagiva V-Raptor 1000. This model started the "praying mantis" style semi-naked bikes. I think its one of the most unique looking bikes in recent years. It's also rare: I believe there are only about 5 Cagiva Raptors in the U.S., and that this is the only V-Raptor model in the country.

History: the Cagiva Raptor was intended to be an alternative to the Ducati Monster and it was designed by the same man who penned the Monster (Galuzzi designed both since Ducati & Cagiva used to be sister companies). While the Monster has an expensive to repair and sometimes tempermental Ducati motor, Cagiva sourced a more powerful 1000 CC V-twin motor from Suzuki - the same motor as Suzuki used in their legendry 1000TL (known as a very fast bike).

Cagiva says the Suzuki motor makes about 112 HP in the V-Raptor - a lot for a bike this light. Best of all: the Suzuki motor is proven, reliable, is not expensive to get parts for if needed, and can be serviced or repaired at just about any motorcycle mechanic or Suzuki dealership. And it is the same motor as used in the Bimota SB8R. 

I bought this bike about a year ago. Since buying it, I had the tank and fairings painted matte white (painter did a good job, not perfect -- but it looks very cool). I installed a different set of bars ("Driven" brand - wider than what it came with for greater comfort). I instaled new mini mirrors and grips. I replaced the headlight bulb with a Silverstar Ultra High Performace bulb and the driving light bulb with an LED bulb.

I also relaced the pipes it came with with a brand new set of Ducati 1088 pipes. I changed the front brake reservoir, changed the brake fluid and bled front and rear brakes. I put in a new battery and clutch cable. I had the radiator pressure tested and flushed and replaced the coolant. I did an oil and filter change and changed the spark plugs (NGK). It has a pretty fresh set of matched expensive Michellin tires. 

Everything that looks like carbon fiber on the bike actually is (except the carbon looking "Cagiva" protective sticker on the engine cover). A prior owner replaced the front fender, the tank "cowls" & the side covers with real carbon parts. The tank, upper fairing and lower fairing are a PVC material material, the rear fender has been deleted, etc....not a lot of fat on this bike. The rear pillion is removeable and there is a passenger seat.

I have been wanting to get the correct front turn signals that fit in the openings in the fairing: the ones on now will work fine, but I haven't wired them up yet. I have also been looking for a new wind screen - this one has been painted matte black and looks good, but it has damage noticeable on inspection. I noticed a drop of oil under the bike last week - I did not change the crush washer when I did the oil change so that may be it.

Starts easy. Runs and shifts well. Does not smoke. All lights and horn work. 
Comes with original pipes, original bars, original mirrors, original "cowl", a box of extras and spares, etc...
48K Miles. Has valid California registration with no back due fees or penalties and a clean title in my name.

Other bikes of this generation (Italian and japanese) will just go down in value - this  one will hold and appreciate due to rarity.
$2,899

***NO SCAMMERS - I will report you. Also, I DO NOT need help selling this motorcycle*** 

Thanks...

Priced $1000 under KBB to sell fast.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll be waiting until Spring and reposting for actual MSRP.

This GSX-R goes 300kph. 190mph. This thing is F.A.S.T. and priced right if you're willing to get into that seat in the budget trim. This bike has more upgrades than I can even list. I will include F.R.E.E. extras in the sale whichever level you choose (see below)~

Clean Title. Current Registration. Starts right up. Fully Serviced. No problems. Needs Nothing. Low Miles. Ready to Canyon, Commute, or Careen at the Track.

This GSXR has Power Modes which literally turn the bike into a 600, 750, or the full 1000 beast. Push of a button, takes 2 seconds.  It's a very cool option for tight technical canyons or close-quarter lane-splitting.

Option 1: As pictured, with those $$$ Carrozzeria Wheels, Brembo Brakes, and many more goodies not seen: $7500
Option 2: Stock Wheels & Brakes, Full Two Bros Black Series & Mystery Door #2 goodies: $5500
Option 3: Don't upsale me with wheels and flashy name-brand stuff, the stock version is fast enough! $5000

Free Delivery, Just detailed the bike, or bring your pessimistic mechanic and lift her skirt in person~

Never been able to use this line when selling one of my bikes...

Accident forces sale. Or to be more accurate - some asshole without insurance or a driver's licence hit me on my way to work and jacked up my shoulder and a year of my life.... I can't ride for another several months. Bike to good home.

2011 Honda CB1000R. 
Registered.
Clear title in hand.
I'm the second owner. Previous owner worked for American Honda, so the bike was taken care of prior to my taking possession.
28900 well cared for miles.
I purchased the bike with 12000miles on the odo. 
I've used this bike for commuting only.  No track days. Hadn't even gotten a chance to hang it out in the canyons...
4.2 gallon gas tank and I can reliably get 140miles/tank exceeding the speed limit at all times. Naked bike, no fairing = great gas mileage is what i'm saying.

Bike is buttery smooth as to be expected for a well sorted Honda inline 4. 
Arkapovic titanium muffler with carbon fiber endcap and actual mid-pipe! True 4 into 1. Not loud, no gimmicky sounding bullshit eBay exhaust. 
Power commander to manage fuel, runs great at all rpm and all angles.....
Fabbri windscreen not installed. It works. I took it off for the photos.
New Michelin Pilot Road 5 tires front and rear - not even scrubbed in yet.

As I alluded to up top. I was hit on the 405 back in May. My body took the brunt of the low speed impact. I'm still recovering from shoulder surgery. The bike was knocked out from under me.
Clutch cover was scraped. Right handlebar was scraped. Right mirror was scrapped. That's it! Bike ran when picked up. Too bad I wasn't in running condition after.
Anyway...New bars, bar ends, grips, mirrors, clutch cover, clutch cover bolts and the bike looks just as good as it did before that shithead hit me. I'm not bitter. Not at all....

You can have the take off parts if you want them. 
Not trying to hide anything. Bike runs great. 
Test ride if you have cash in hand or leave me the keys to your truck.....and a motorcycle endorsement on your license. That's actually a deal breaker for me. Go figure. Bring a helmet too because you can't borrow mine. That's just gross. And weird.

Email me your cell number, I'll text you back and you can check it out.

Great bike. I'm retired and having neck surgery so my riding days are done. Time for an RV. Only owner and only rider. Many extra's including Power Commander 5, Two Bros Pipes, Center Stand, Factory Gel Seat, Givi 43 liter top box w/ Givi mounting gear, Givi engine guards, Madstad Bracket w/ Givi tall windscreen, Battery Tender Jr and cords and for an extra $50 I'll include a pair of fleece lined Hippo Hands which are priceless in colder weather. Oh and it has heated grips as well. Cash only and I mean currency. No checks. It has been a great commuter for me and a great bike for canyons and coastal routes. It has started every time I pressed the starter without fail. I've worked in a bike shop for the last 13 years that has Suzuki as one of it's lines so you can count on it being very well maintained. Never more than 3500 between oil changes. Only Motul 5100 in the engine. Serious people only please. KBB excellent condition is $4500 but I know the miles are a bit high for some so hence the lower price. Tires are also in good shape. Michelin Pilot Road 3's with easily 10k left. I also have a spare air filter and brake pads that I'm including.
Just renewed plates. Be happy to go to AAA with you to insure smooth transfer. Please email if you have questions or would like to come and see it.
Also will include a lot of riding gear if you're a large guy like me, 6'2...250... Jackets, gloves cold pants and cold weather riding suit. Bout $1000+ of gear...

Hello CL, up for sale is this fuel injected 1000cc torque monster! 
   This bike is tastefully modified and has been adult owened and never stunted or abused. Completely updated suspension from a zx10 with the large radial mounted brakes for better stopping power rounding off the braking is a brembo RSC 19 master cylinder with steel braided brake lines with EBC HH brake pads to better clamp the rotors. Fenomenal stopping power!
Outback is the Zx10 rear shock for better handling, Dunlop q3's for better cornering. New chain kit with one tooth up outback along with a custom machined flywheel for great acceleration new Barnett clutch and clutch cable for smooth action. Rounding off the power is a FULL TITANIUM PIPE made by Mr. Kawasaki Rob "Muzzy" power commander K&N air. Filter with a custom modified air box for better air flow. That's just on tap, regularly maintained with primium motorcycle specific fluids including primium gasoline. 
   This bike is solid and very reliable.  Unfortunately the previous owner lowsided it at low speed so there is a small flat spot on the tank and road rash on the fairing it's only cosmetic flaws that does not affect the performance. I purchased this bike completely stock and modified it to my liking, those that know about motorcycles and motorcycle performance can see and appreciate the modifications. The seating position on this bike is very comfortable almost dirt bike like therefore splitting lanes on the gridlocked freeways is easy peasy! Plus the pipe sounds loud enough to warn motorists. NOW That said, serious buyers only CASH ONLY! Scammers will be ignored no trades CASH ONLY! No payments CASH ONLY! No shipping COD ONLY! NO Military shipping of any kind CASH ONLY!

Up for sale is my '07 R1 sport bike. It has been regularly maintained with synthetic Mobil 1 racing 4T motor oil only. This bike has <15k on the clock. The fork suspension has just been serviced, with new seals, boots, and oil. The gearing has been changed from OEM to a "power up" configuration, shifting the power band to a more effective, user-friendly (and much more fun) range. This bike has a wet weight of 480 lbs, and has 156 base horsepower. It has Michelin Pilot Power 2CT tires (my favorite for this kind of bike) with plenty of meat left on em. It has some aftermarket features, including custom fairings, custom rear sets, and a few other things. This bike is street legal, with current registration till May, 2019. I'm motivated to sell, so will consider any REASONABLE offer. For a quick sale I'm asking $5000 or best offer. Test ride with collateral (cash or otherwise) and a valid M1 class license only.

$5000

QR Code Link to This Post


I am selling a 2006 Yamaha R1 with 5031 miles.  It used to be a dedicated track bike, which is why it has such low mileage.  It has a clean title and is Non-OP'd, so it can easily be converted back to a street bike if wanted.  The bike comes with an extra, brand new set of Bridgestone BT002's.  This bike is in near immaculate condition and was extremely well maintained.   

THE GOOD:

-Termignoni full Titanium exhaust
-Ohlins steering damper 
-Cycle Cat upper triple clamp 
-Cycle Cat rearsets
-BMC air filter 
-Harris upper/front fairing stay
-Motovation frame and rear axle sliders
-Rizoma brake fluid reservoirs 
-Carbon fiber exhaust shields
-SS brake lines
-LOW MILEAGE
-free set of tires.  Bridgestone BT002's

THE BAD:
-the only negative with this bike is it was lowsided at Thunderhill in turn 11.  It has a dent in the gas tank as a result, and some wear on the left side frame slider and air duct.  please see pics.  only cosmetic damage.


No lowballers.  No test rides without cash in hand and a valid M1.

A lot of bike for the money. Some cosmetic issues, paint scratches, dent in fuel tank. All due to minor low side. The bike is mechanically sound, a fantastic ride with great suspension, tons of power and great brakes. Year 2007, Yamaha corrected fuel injection mapping issues, throttle response is perfect. New brake pads, tires have plenty of tread, ( new Bridgestone rear tire, and set of spark plugs included). I am a 76 year old rider. The bike has been well maintained, no track days, never abused. Only selling because of spouse's  anxiety issues.
   Some extras: adjustable levers, GYTR carbon exhaust, tail cleanup, flush led turn signals, Yamaha comfy gel seat. Some riding apparel available.

May TRADE for another bike of equal value with low miles. Bikes of interest are BMW, Yamaha FZ1, Ducati Multistrada, kawasaki, Aprilia, Honda VFR Interceptor, looking for a good Two up Bike. Adventure bike.  I'm not interested in a project bike or any junk with issues.

Wonderful beast. I bought this bike immediately after hearing the engine start - the sound is fantastic. The adjustable shock (from 'S' model) is nice to have... I keep it stiff when riding solo and ease it up when adding a passenger.

First owner rode til about 18,000 miles, then I bought it in 2013 and rode to current mileage, which is around 41,500. She is still in great condition, though with the minor scuffs you'd expect. Garage parked, no accidents.

Mods:
- I installed the Givi top case, which is specifically the V47NT Tech Black 47 Litre Monokey model. It holds two full face helmets and is easy to remove from bike when not needed.
- Sargent seat and tinted touring screen put on by previous owner.
- Lights, bars, exhaust are all stock.

Maintenance has been regular and last service was done less than 2000 miles ago. Here are some recent replacements:
- Front and rear tires have less than 1500 miles, currently Angel GTs. Front fork seals replaced, rear brake pad replaced, and chain serviced at same time.
- Full annual service done about 9 months ago, including oil service, chain adjust, fluids check, and safety inspection.
- Battery is good and she starts quickly, usually after one or two turns of the engine.

I had Munroe do a Used Bike inspection report which I can share as well. It shows that all is well with the bike, esp. mechanically. A Vehicle History Report from VINCheckup.com is also available showing no accidents, liens, etc.

Most service done at Munroe, some at Desmoto. Registration good until early 2019.
Title in hand.

Up for sale is my 2012 BMW S1000RR. 
If you know how to work on bikes, don't miss out on this opportunity. As you can see the bike needs a few parts replaced but I've got a list of everything and it's going to be about $3000 to get it back in good shape.
This bike is an absolute BEAST ! Untouchable on the streets. It's a very rare color which was only made in 2012, its called fire blue. The bike has 24,xxx miles on it and still holds a clean title. This bike originally sold for $22,000. It's 200 HP at the rear wheel and 200 mph whenever you want it. The bike is dyno tuned with a Power Commander 5 and AERO exhaust . It's got Abs and traction control ! Also 4 different power settings accessible on the fly. (Slick)(rain)(Sport)(RACE) each unleash different levels of riders assists. It comes with Ohlins 10 way adjustable suspension & BREMBO brakes.
Most people dont know but this bike also comes with the electronic quick shift feature from the factory. (Sounds amazing when you're going through the gears)
·Motor and transmission are in tip top shape
The bike will come with everything you see including 
- Power commander 5
- Carbon Fiber AERO exhaust
- Fully adjustable VORTEX rear sets
- Adjustable levers
- Yoshimura license plate kit with LED light
- Brand New soft compound rear tire
- Brand new Galfer rear brakes

Here's what it needs

· Fork assembly $1350
· Front Intake assembly $25
· Headlight Bracket $45
· Front rim $230
· Rear rim $300
· Left side / front fairings $400
· Radiator $405
· Oil cooler $240

I have managed to find all the parts online. I just dont have time to work on the bike so I'm going to cut ties with it. My loss is your gain. There is money to be made on this thing. The motor alone is worth $2500. Transmission is worth another $2500. Even the gas tank is worth $1500


Im asking $2500 firm for the bike. After it's fixed this bike is worth over $9k so there's still plenty of room for profit. 
If interested call or text me at  show contact info

From Motorcycle Enthusiast magazine"
"Lean and capable, the Concours™ has meant sport-touring bliss for motorcycle fans. Its formula? A great sport-touring chassis, muscular 997cc Ninja®-inspired In-line Four engine, big 7.5-gallon fuel tank and detachable hard bags. Steer the Concours up a winding touring road just once, and you'll wish you had discovered it earlier.

When it comes to sport-touring, it doesn't get much better than the Kawasaki Concours™ motorcycle. The bike is equipped with a sportbike-style fairing that offers ample wind protection, and hard saddlebags for loads of carrying capacity, and there's the added benefit of the Concours™ power and handling ability that is on par with the NINJA® sportbikes. The Kawasaki Concours is equally ideal for long-distance adventure and daily commuting alike"

Title is clean.
Current Miles: 15,xxx

Parts Replaced:
Air Duct
Left Headlight

Services:
-I have service records which includes a valve adjustment which I did myself. I'll be more than happy to provide all proof of documentation as request! 
-Most recent service was an oil change and changing out the rear brake pads along with re-bleeding it. 06/30/18

Misc:
-Leo Vince Slip ons (Will include stock exhaust)
-Metzler Roadtech Z8 tires
-New Battery (Replaced as of 06/30/18)
-EK MVXZ2 Series 520 Chain

Ducati ST4S, like new condition 16,000 miles. I know the history from the first owner (from Palo Alto area) and I do have original red key, red code number, and extra key. It was just tuned up, valves etc. and all the services are up to date. Services were done at Nichol's and Advanced Cysle Service. It just got new tires, new brake pads, new front shocks (there was an oil leak), new chain. It has a lot of extras:

- Sergant leather seat (+ original seat)
- Bar risers
- Throttle lock
- Two extra windshields (+ original Ducati)
- camera installed
- extra power outlets
- Frame sliders
- Front axle sliders
- Givi monolock top case
- Side mirrors with integrated signals (+ original ones)

There are no scratches nor dents. There is only a very small crack at the side frame at the screw, hardly visible (shown in pictures)

This is a fast bike 117hp, fun and sporty but comfortable for a long ride. A true sport touring bike. They do not make it any longer and this was the best Ducati model in this category.

Why am I selling it? I am getting too old to ride. It is risky.  This is a crazy good deal on this bike. Don't be fooled by the low price. It's an awesome deal and an awesome bike, with pedigre.

Cash and your valid M1 license in my hand, if you want a test drive. Serious inquires only. No tire kickers. No asking what is my lowest price. It is what you see. No offerings for MotoFax, I know the trick.

2005 Kawasaki Concours ZG1000

4 cylinder engine, liquid cooled, disk brakes (dual in front).  There are tons of sites online with information about this bike and specs if you want to check them out.

I bought this from the original owner back in 2011.  It's a great bike.  Although I never thought I would sell this bike, I simply do not ride anymore and need to be practical.  This bike is amazingly reliable - in my 7 years of ownership, I don't think I have done anything but maintenance type work (nothing breaks).

Bike just had the carburetor taken apart and cleaned and got a clean bill of health.  Runs very well and so much fun to drive.  The bike is very comfortable and great for long road trips which is primarily what the first owner and I used it for (thus the included accessories outlined below).  

Aftermarket accessories included (installed on bike):
1) Givi trunk
2) Handlebar risers (allow you to position yourself a little more straight up (rather than forward) - must for long rides)
3) Throttle lock (for a cruise control-like experience) and matching end cap for other handlebar
4) 12V cigarette lighter adapter in dash
5) Aux power lead to battery (to connect battery tender or battery powered bike suit)

First pic is stock, the others are recent pics of the actual bike.  While not shown in all the pics, the side bags come with the bike.

I'm selling my 2003 Yamaha FZ-1. It runs good and is very reliable and it's a very fast bike. It has the same engine as the R1 race bike, except Yamaha de-tuned it a bit so it's better for touring. It's one of the most comfortable bikes I've ever owned. I can't ride crotch rockets for very long so this is the next best thing. Great for long rides and it handles great. I'm only selling because I will be moving out of state in a few months and don't want to move it. It has several upgrades from the previous owner as well as some scratches on the side from when he went down at about 10mph. It doesn't effect the bike in any way other than looks. The engine has aftermarket crash guards so there is no engine damage, it just pushed the bars into the tank on one side and cracked the front fairing. I would be willing to trade or partial trade on a trailer for when I move, other than that cash only, and cash in my hand before you even think about riding it, sorry no exceptions, this bike is too fast. Call Tony at 847 nine eight seven 000 three

The upgrades on this bike alone were well over $1500. This has the extremely rare (impossible to find) multi-gauge that replaced the stock fuel gauge with an integrated display that tells, gear position, fuel, speed, temp, etc.

Aftermarket upgrades: 
Sargent Seat $300+  - Extremely more comfort for long rides
Penske Racing rear shock $500+ - fully adjustable
Engine guards $85
Multi-gauge display, was $500 installed - impossible to find, when you can, people still pay $300 for them
Yoshimura Pipe $400 - Sounds sweet
Pirelli Angel GT tires $300 - these are the absolute best tire for a sport-touring bike, I'll never use another tire.

Hi CL, I'm selling my 2005 FZ1. Broke my leg badly (not riding) and required surgery. Can't ride for 6+ months, and I need the money to pay for the surgery. The bike has been 100% garage kept and responsibly ridden (daily) as a commuter bike. Clean title, registration through May 2019.

- Back tire same model, 70% tread left
New battery ($110)

Carb clean and Sync ($200)
Spark Plugs (4 x $5)
Chain Lube (Only half a tank ridden since)

Size: 998cc
Horsepower: 120

Was a daily but got a new job further away.  I will be moving so my baby has to find a new home. This is a very fun bike and commuting to work I always had a smile on my face.  I also used to ride to Orange county and back on the weekends which is where most of the miles came from.

The Good:
Givi windscreen with adjustable mount
New Battery
Throttle lock (this should be a must for every bike)
Just paid registration, just need sticker for 11/2019
Cheap/removable top case

The bad: 
1. Seat starting to crack and a large crack has developed on the right side.  I would recommend a more comfortable seat anyway, my regret is not buying one.
2. Dusty.   Needs a wash.  Pictures show current state except one from when it was clean.
3. Right side of topcase scratched up.  This is from when I used to park in a garage to make room to walk through.


No trades or tattoos or other offers. Cash only.  Prefer initial email communication.
I work out of town during the week so viewing will need to be on the weekends

For sale is my 2008 cbr 1000rr. Was my daily rider for a year and a half. From the first owner I got it from at 5k miles. I took it to the mechanic because I heard a rattling one day. They told me it was fine sand into the engine through the airbox and it'll need a new engine unfortunately. This bike was really fun and I hate to sell it like this, but I had already planned on using this bike as a downpayment on another bike and now plans have changed. All services were done on the bike. All parts work and bike still runs (mechanic said rattling will get louder the more its ridden) since everything else works that's why I am starting at a high asking price. I had also recently put new brakes and had new fork seals put onto the bike no more than 3000 miles ago. 

Someone who's willing to replace the engine will have a really fun bike on their hands. Will add pictures when possible.

Mods:

Two brothers exhaust with midpipe and fender eliminator kit (previous owner)

520 chain conversion ~5000 miles ago

Pirelli Angel GT tires ~50% tread

Awesome 2007 Ducati Monster S2R 1000 up for sale. The S2R has the single sided swingarm that most regular monsters did not have and it is the 1000cc version (there was a 800 s2r) honestly I really like this bike and it is great but I have been doing more track riding and want a track bike. The bike runs great and sounds great, Houston Super Bikes tuned the ECU. Awesome bike for what ever you want to do, commuting or canyons or track it is great.

There is only 7k miles on the bike and it runs perfect. All maintenance has been meticulously done and it needs nothing. Clean title in hand with 2 keys and a passenger seat.

Clean Title
Willing to negiotiate
The bike is $2400 because there is a ticking noise and I don't have the money to chase this issue and pay for it.
I put all my love into this bike and I'm sad to have to get rid of it for college.
This bike has had maintenance whenever it needed it.
Below is a list of important factors about this bike:
Brand new cam chain tensioner, oil, and oil filter. I rode the bike home 2 miles and haven't rode it since the shop did this.
Brand new clutch cable replaced after it broke.
The entire front triple tree was ripped out and replaced.
Relatively new front and bike Michelin Road 5 tires.
Brand new front rotors.
Upgraded suspension.
Adjustable brake lever.
Upgraded sprocket (2 teeth down in the front, 3 teeth up in the back).

I'm sure there's more I'm leaving out, but contact me if you have any questions about the bike.

2005 Kawasaki Concours - ZG1000

$1300

QR Code Link to This Post


Hello Everyone, 

I'm selling my 2005 Kawasaki Concours, ZG 1000. 

I love this bike, but I need to sell it. It has one main issue which is why I'm selling for $1300 OBO. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY! Issue listed below.

Like most sport-touring models, this bike has a comfortable seat and is a nice ride with good acceleration. The bike has about 25k miles on it. I've kept and maintained it since I've owned it over the past 2-3 years. I've worked on it myself, but have also taken it in to be serviced at a dealer. 

This bike is great for commuting; It used to be my daily driver for my commute to school and work. I could pack all I needed for the day in my saddle bags and on the luggage rack. The ride is comfortable and still has power when you need it. 

Cosmetic/ Accessories:
1. (2) front pockets 
2. Speakers with AUX cable in front-left pocket
3. 12V receptacle; works with car charger adapters, I use it to charge my phone or iPod when I have my music going.
4. (2) hard-shelled saddle bags
5. Handle bar throttle-lock cruise control
6. Passenger back-rest
7. Small luggage rack base
8. I'm including the recently bought hex-head bolts to replace most of the factory installed ones and the service manual


Maintenance:
1. Recent oil/filter change (About 3 months ago)
2. Coolant flush/replacement
3. Rebuilt master/slave clutch cylinders
4. New front brake pads
5. New rear brake pads (need to be installed)
6. Cleaned out the carburetors when I first bought it
7. Fairly new tires with plenty of tread left

Needs work:
1. The acceleration isn't always there. From the feel of the throttle, it may need to have the clutch disks replaced. (This is why I am selling it; as a student and being recently engaged I can't put any money in to the bike)
2. small oil drip at the oil pan bolt; bought a new washer to be installed, but I haven't installed it because I wanted to buy a magnetic oil pan bolt.
3. Some scratches on the fairings; cracked plastics near the right turn signal.
4. Cracked left mirror

Besides these things, everything works fine. 

NOTE: THE BIKE RUNS AND RIDES, BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND A WAY TO TRANSPORT IT AS PER THE ISSUE LISTED ABOVE

If all this sounds good to you, feel free to email or send a text to (nine zero nine) two six zero - eight six two five AGAIN, ONLY SERIOUS INQUIRES! I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME. I AM OFTEN BUSY FROM 6:30AM-8PM WEEKDAYS SO WEEKENDS ARE THE BEST TIME TO LOOK AT THE BIKE. I will respond more quickly to text, so text is preferred!

2003 Cagiva V-Raptor

2003 CAGIVA RAPTOR a/k/a Ducati Monster 2: very rare, excellent shape!

$2899

QR Code Link to This Post


Up for sale is my 2003 Cagiva V-Raptor 1000. This model started the "praying mantis" style semi-naked bikes. I think its one of the most unique looking bikes in recent years. It's also rare: I believe there are only about 5 Cagiva Raptors in the U.S., and that this is the only V-Raptor model in the country.

History: the Cagiva Raptor was intended to be an alternative to the Ducati Monster and it was designed by the same man who penned the Monster (Galuzzi designed both since Ducati & Cagiva used to be sister companies). While the Monster has an expensive to repair and sometimes tempermental Ducati motor, Cagiva sourced a more powerful 1000 CC V-twin motor from Suzuki - the same motor as Suzuki used in their legendry 1000TL (known as a very fast bike).

Cagiva says the Suzuki motor makes about 112 HP in the V-Raptor - a lot for a bike this light. Best of all: the Suzuki motor is proven, reliable, is not expensive to get parts for if needed, and can be serviced or repaired at just about any motorcycle mechanic or Suzuki dealership. And it is the same motor as used in the Bimota SB8R. 

I bought this bike about a year ago. Since buying it, I had the tank and fairings painted matte white (painter did a good job, not perfect -- but it looks very cool). I installed a different set of bars ("Driven" brand - wider than what it came with for greater comfort). I instaled new mini mirrors and grips. I replaced the headlight bulb with a Silverstar Ultra High Performace bulb and the driving light bulb with an LED bulb.

I also relaced the pipes it came with with a brand new set of Ducati 1088 pipes. I changed the front brake reservoir, changed the brake fluid and bled front and rear brakes. I put in a new battery and clutch cable. I had the radiator pressure tested and flushed and replaced the coolant. I did an oil and filter change and changed the spark plugs (NGK). It has a pretty fresh set of matched expensive Michellin tires. 

Everything that looks like carbon fiber on the bike actually is (except the carbon looking "Cagiva" protective sticker on the engine cover). A prior owner replaced the front fender, the tank "cowls" & the side covers with real carbon parts. The tank, upper fairing and lower fairing are a PVC material material, the rear fender has been deleted, etc....not a lot of fat on this bike. The rear pillion is removeable and there is a passenger seat.

I have been wanting to get the correct front turn signals that fit in the openings in the fairing: the ones on now will work fine, but I haven't wired them up yet. I have also been looking for a new wind screen - this one has been painted matte black and looks good, but it has damage noticeable on inspection. I noticed a drop of oil under the bike last week - I did not change the crush washer when I did the oil change so that may be it.

Starts easy. Runs and shifts well. Does not smoke. All lights and horn work. 
Comes with original pipes, original bars, original mirrors, original "cowl", a box of extras and spares, etc...
48K Miles. Has valid California registration with no back due fees or penalties and a clean title in my name.

Other bikes of this generation (Italian and japanese) will just go down in value - this  one will hold and appreciate due to rarity.
$2,899

***NO SCAMMERS - I will report you. Also, I DO NOT need help selling this motorcycle*** 

Thanks...

Priced $1000 under KBB to sell fast.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll be waiting until Spring and reposting for actual MSRP.

This GSX-R goes 300kph. 190mph. This thing is F.A.S.T. and priced right if you're willing to get into that seat in the budget trim. This bike has more upgrades than I can even list. I will include F.R.E.E. extras in the sale whichever level you choose (see below)~

Clean Title. Current Registration. Starts right up. Fully Serviced. No problems. Needs Nothing. Low Miles. Ready to Canyon, Commute, or Careen at the Track.

This GSXR has Power Modes which literally turn the bike into a 600, 750, or the full 1000 beast. Push of a button, takes 2 seconds.  It's a very cool option for tight technical canyons or close-quarter lane-splitting.

Option 1: As pictured, with those $$$ Carrozzeria Wheels, Brembo Brakes, and many more goodies not seen: $7500
Option 2: Stock Wheels & Brakes, Full Two Bros Black Series & Mystery Door #2 goodies: $5500
Option 3: Don't upsale me with wheels and flashy name-brand stuff, the stock version is fast enough! $5000

Free Delivery, Just detailed the bike, or bring your pessimistic mechanic and lift her skirt in person~

Awesome 2007 Ducati Monster S2R 1000 up for sale. The S2R has the single sided swingarm that most regular monsters did not have and it is the 1000cc version (there was a 800 s2r) honestly I  really like this bike and it is great but I have been doing more track riding and want a track bike. The bike runs great and sounds great, Houston Super Bikes tuned the ECU. Awesome bike for what ever you want to do, commuting or canyons or track it is great.

Never been able to use this line when selling one of my bikes...

Accident forces sale. Or to be more accurate - some asshole without insurance or a driver's licence hit me on my way to work and jacked up my shoulder and a year of my life.... I can't ride for another several months. Bike to good home.

2011 Honda CB1000R. 
Registered.
Clear title in hand.
I'm the second owner. Previous owner worked for American Honda, so the bike was taken care of prior to my taking possession.
28900 well cared for miles.
I purchased the bike with 12000miles on the odo. 
I've used this bike for commuting only.  No track days. Hadn't even gotten a chance to hang it out in the canyons...
4.2 gallon gas tank and I can reliably get 140miles/tank exceeding the speed limit at all times. Naked bike, no fairing = great gas mileage is what i'm saying.

Bike is buttery smooth as to be expected for a well sorted Honda inline 4. 
Arkapovic titanium muffler with carbon fiber endcap and actual mid-pipe! True 4 into 1. Not loud, no gimmicky sounding bullshit eBay exhaust. 
Power commander to manage fuel, runs great at all rpm and all angles.....
Fabbri windscreen not installed. It works. I took it off for the photos.
New Michelin Pilot Road 5 tires front and rear - not even scrubbed in yet.

As I alluded to up top. I was hit on the 405 back in May. My body took the brunt of the low speed impact. I'm still recovering from shoulder surgery. The bike was knocked out from under me.
Clutch cover was scraped. Right handlebar was scraped. Right mirror was scrapped. That's it! Bike ran when picked up. Too bad I wasn't in running condition after.
Anyway...New bars, bar ends, grips, mirrors, clutch cover, clutch cover bolts and the bike looks just as good as it did before that shithead hit me. I'm not bitter. Not at all....

You can have the take off parts if you want them. 
Not trying to hide anything. Bike runs great. 
Test ride if you have cash in hand or leave me the keys to your truck.....and a motorcycle endorsement on your license. That's actually a deal breaker for me. Go figure. Bring a helmet too because you can't borrow mine. That's just gross. And weird.

Email me your cell number, I'll text you back and you can check it out.

Great bike. I'm retired and having neck surgery so my riding days are done. Time for an RV. Only owner and only rider. Many extra's including Power Commander 5, Two Bros Pipes, Center Stand, Factory Gel Seat, Givi 43 liter top box w/ Givi mounting gear, Givi engine guards, Madstad Bracket w/ Givi tall windscreen, Battery Tender Jr and cords and for an extra $50 I'll include a pair of fleece lined Hippo Hands which are priceless in colder weather. Oh and it has heated grips as well. Cash only and I mean currency. No checks. It has been a great commuter for me and a great bike for canyons and coastal routes. It has started every time I pressed the starter without fail. I've worked in a bike shop for the last 13 years that has Suzuki as one of it's lines so you can count on it being very well maintained. Never more than 3500 between oil changes. Only Motul 5100 in the engine. Serious people only please. KBB excellent condition is $4500 but I know the miles are a bit high for some so hence the lower price. Tires are also in good shape. Michelin Pilot Road 3's with easily 10k left. I also have a spare air filter and brake pads that I'm including.
Just renewed plates. Be happy to go to AAA with you to insure smooth transfer. Please email if you have questions or would like to come and see it.
Also will include a lot of riding gear if you're a large guy like me, 6'2...250... Jackets, gloves cold pants and cold weather riding suit. Bout $1000+ of gear...

Hello CL, up for sale is this fuel injected 1000cc torque monster! 
   This bike is tastefully modified and has been adult owened and never stunted or abused. Completely updated suspension from a zx10 with the large radial mounted brakes for better stopping power rounding off the braking is a brembo RSC 19 master cylinder with steel braided brake lines with EBC HH brake pads to better clamp the rotors. Fenomenal stopping power!
Outback is the Zx10 rear shock for better handling, Dunlop q3's for better cornering. New chain kit with one tooth up outback along with a custom machined flywheel for great acceleration new Barnett clutch and clutch cable for smooth action. Rounding off the power is a FULL TITANIUM PIPE made by Mr. Kawasaki Rob "Muzzy" power commander K&N air. Filter with a custom modified air box for better air flow. That's just on tap, regularly maintained with primium motorcycle specific fluids including primium gasoline. 
   This bike is solid and very reliable.  Unfortunately the previous owner lowsided it at low speed so there is a small flat spot on the tank and road rash on the fairing it's only cosmetic flaws that does not affect the performance. I purchased this bike completely stock and modified it to my liking, those that know about motorcycles and motorcycle performance can see and appreciate the modifications. The seating position on this bike is very comfortable almost dirt bike like therefore splitting lanes on the gridlocked freeways is easy peasy! Plus the pipe sounds loud enough to warn motorists. NOW That said, serious buyers only CASH ONLY! Scammers will be ignored no trades CASH ONLY! No payments CASH ONLY! No shipping COD ONLY! NO Military shipping of any kind CASH ONLY!

This posting is for one 2008 Mv Agusta 312R F4 1000. 

  This bike is in Immaculate condition and runs well. It has 3,500 miles and is slowly climbing. There's only 150 produced for the US and this may be the the nicest one around in this color scheme. It's time to pass this beauty on for someone else to enjoy. The registration is current and it's ready to ride. I'm asking $9,000

May TRADE for another bike of equal value with low miles. Bikes of interest are BMW, Yamaha FZ1, Ducati Multistrada, kawasaki, Aprilia, Honda VFR Interceptor, looking for a good Two up Bike. Adventure bike.  I'm not interested in a project bike or any junk with issues.

I dont have to sell this bike, I love it, but I have too many vehicles, and too many projects, with too little time.
I ride this to work every few days, its got fresh gas, and has been ridden regularly. not sitting around.
Changed the oil last week, Plenty of tread on both tires, Rides and handles excellent!
Comes with the tank bag pictured, and some extra parts, my helmet, jacket, everything.
These bikes are known for magnets breaking loose on the crank magneto and I have a new replacement with gasket in case this happens. Custom USB port on dash with built in volt meter installed so you can monitor the charging voltage to know when this is starting.

If you want to test drive it, bring cash, while you are test riding it, Im holding your $3000. you crash it, you bought it.
Title is clean, 49 state bike, reg is current.

Price is firm, but partial trades will be considered.

Wonderful beast. I bought this bike immediately after hearing the engine start - the sound is fantastic. The adjustable shock (from 'S' model) is nice to have... I keep it stiff when riding solo and ease it up when adding a passenger.

First owner rode til about 18,000 miles, then I bought it in 2013 and rode to current mileage, which is around 41,500. She is still in great condition, though with the minor scuffs you'd expect. Garage parked, no accidents.

Mods:
- I installed the Givi top case, which is specifically the V47NT Tech Black 47 Litre Monokey model. It holds two full face helmets and is easy to remove from bike when not needed.
- Sargent seat and tinted touring screen put on by previous owner.
- Lights, bars, exhaust are all stock.

Maintenance has been regular and last service was done less than 2000 miles ago. Here are some recent replacements:
- Front and rear tires have less than 1500 miles, currently Angel GTs. Front fork seals replaced, rear brake pad replaced, and chain serviced at same time.
- Full annual service done about 9 months ago, including oil service, chain adjust, fluids check, and safety inspection.
- Battery is good and she starts quickly, usually after one or two turns of the engine.

I had Munroe do a Used Bike inspection report which I can share as well. It shows that all is well with the bike, esp. mechanically. A Vehicle History Report from VINCheckup.com is also available showing no accidents, liens, etc.

Most service done at Munroe, some at Desmoto. Registration good until early 2019.
Title in hand.

Up for sale is my 2012 BMW S1000RR. 
If you know how to work on bikes, don't miss out on this opportunity. As you can see the bike needs a few parts replaced but I've got a list of everything and it's going to be about $3000 to get it back in good shape.
This bike is an absolute BEAST ! Untouchable on the streets. It's a very rare color which was only made in 2012, its called fire blue. The bike has 24,xxx miles on it and still holds a clean title. This bike originally sold for $22,000. It's 200 HP at the rear wheel and 200 mph whenever you want it. The bike is dyno tuned with a Power Commander 5 and AERO exhaust . It's got Abs and traction control ! Also 4 different power settings accessible on the fly. (Slick)(rain)(Sport)(RACE) each unleash different levels of riders assists. It comes with Ohlins 10 way adjustable suspension & BREMBO brakes.
Most people dont know but this bike also comes with the electronic quick shift feature from the factory. (Sounds amazing when you're going through the gears)
·Motor and transmission are in tip top shape
The bike will come with everything you see including 
- Power commander 5
- Carbon Fiber AERO exhaust
- Fully adjustable VORTEX rear sets
- Adjustable levers
- Yoshimura license plate kit with LED light
- Brand New soft compound rear tire
- Brand new Galfer rear brakes

Here's what it needs

· Fork assembly $1350
· Front Intake assembly $25
· Headlight Bracket $45
· Front rim $230
· Rear rim $300
· Left side / front fairings $400
· Radiator $405
· Oil cooler $240

I have managed to find all the parts online. I just dont have time to work on the bike so I'm going to cut ties with it. My loss is your gain. There is money to be made on this thing. The motor alone is worth $2500. Transmission is worth another $2500. Even the gas tank is worth $1500


Im asking $2500 firm for the bike. After it's fixed this bike is worth over $9k so there's still plenty of room for profit. 
If interested call or text me at  show contact info

From Motorcycle Enthusiast magazine"
"Lean and capable, the Concours™ has meant sport-touring bliss for motorcycle fans. Its formula? A great sport-touring chassis, muscular 997cc Ninja®-inspired In-line Four engine, big 7.5-gallon fuel tank and detachable hard bags. Steer the Concours up a winding touring road just once, and you'll wish you had discovered it earlier.

When it comes to sport-touring, it doesn't get much better than the Kawasaki Concours™ motorcycle. The bike is equipped with a sportbike-style fairing that offers ample wind protection, and hard saddlebags for loads of carrying capacity, and there's the added benefit of the Concours™ power and handling ability that is on par with the NINJA® sportbikes. The Kawasaki Concours is equally ideal for long-distance adventure and daily commuting alike"

Hey everyone!

As far as I know, I'm the second owner, previous owner downed it, I replaced all necessary parts to get it in running condition but there are still some scratches on the bike but they are minor.

I removed some of the decals due to it being faded and I just haven't gotten around to buying a new set to replace them.

Title is clean.
Current Miles: 15,xxx

Parts Replaced:
Air Duct
Left Headlight

Services:
-I have service records which includes a valve adjustment which I did myself. I'll be more than happy to provide all proof of documentation as request! 
-Most recent service was an oil change and changing out the rear brake pads along with re-bleeding it. 06/30/18

Misc:
-Leo Vince Slip ons (Will include stock exhaust)
-Metzler Roadtech Z8 tires
-New Battery (Replaced as of 06/30/18)
-EK MVXZ2 Series 520 Chain

Ducati ST4S, like new condition 16,000 miles. I know the history from the first owner (from Palo Alto area) and I do have original red key, red code number, and extra key. It was just tuned up, valves etc. and all the services are up to date. Services were done at Nichol's and Advanced Cysle Service. It just got new tires, new brake pads, new front shocks (there was an oil leak), new chain. It has a lot of extras:

- Sergant leather seat (+ original seat)
- Bar risers
- Throttle lock
- Two extra windshields (+ original Ducati)
- camera installed
- extra power outlets
- Frame sliders
- Front axle sliders
- Givi monolock top case
- Side mirrors with integrated signals (+ original ones)

There are no scratches nor dents. There is only a very small crack at the side frame at the screw, hardly visible (shown in pictures)

This is a fast bike 117hp, fun and sporty but comfortable for a long ride. A true sport touring bike. They do not make it any longer and this was the best Ducati model in this category.

Why am I selling it? I am getting too old to ride. It is risky.  This is a crazy good deal on this bike. Don't be fooled by the low price. It's an awesome deal and an awesome bike, with pedigre.

Cash and your valid M1 license in my hand, if you want a test drive. Serious inquires only. No tire kickers. No asking what is my lowest price. It is what you see. No offerings for MotoFax, I know the trick.

2005 Kawasaki Concours ZG1000

4 cylinder engine, liquid cooled, disk brakes (dual in front).  There are tons of sites online with information about this bike and specs if you want to check them out.

I bought this from the original owner back in 2011.  It's a great bike.  Although I never thought I would sell this bike, I simply do not ride anymore and need to be practical.  This bike is amazingly reliable - in my 7 years of ownership, I don't think I have done anything but maintenance type work (nothing breaks).

Bike just had the carburetor taken apart and cleaned and got a clean bill of health.  Runs very well and so much fun to drive.  The bike is very comfortable and great for long road trips which is primarily what the first owner and I used it for (thus the included accessories outlined below).  

Aftermarket accessories included (installed on bike):
1) Givi trunk
2) Handlebar risers (allow you to position yourself a little more straight up (rather than forward) - must for long rides)
3) Throttle lock (for a cruise control-like experience) and matching end cap for other handlebar
4) 12V cigarette lighter adapter in dash
5) Aux power lead to battery (to connect battery tender or battery powered bike suit)

First pic is stock, the others are recent pics of the actual bike.  While not shown in all the pics, the side bags come with the bike.

I have for sale a 2005 Honda Superhawk VTR 1000, v twin. very torque, fun to ride. Very comfortable Corbin seat. Driven daily as a commuter. adult owned(60) Recent new parts- front brake pads, rear brake pads, drive chain, oil and filter changed, tapered steering head bearings. also has wind guards for hands to deflect the cold air and rain. includes lower aftermarket fairing, Aftermarket Jardine exhaust slip-ons, sounds awesome, not annoying. This bike is very reliable, very nice condition and fun to ride. Mileage is 53,500 which is nothing for these bikes. I also own a 2002 vtr1000 and have 143,000 on it and it still runs excellent.

A lot of bike for the money. Some cosmetic issues, paint scratches, dent in fuel tank. All due to minor low side. The bike is mechanically sound, a fantastic ride with great suspension, tons of power and great brakes. Year 2007, Yamaha corrected fuel injection mapping issues, throttle response is perfect. New brake pads, tires have plenty of tread, ( new Bridgestone rear tire, and set of spark plugs included). I am a 76 year old rider. The bike has been well maintained, no track days, never abused. Only selling because of spouse's  anxiety issues.
   Some extras: adjustable levers, GYTR carbon exhaust, tail cleanup, flush led turn signals, Yamaha comfy gel seat. Some riding apparel available.

Bike rides perfect, smooth on acceleration and the twisties.  

Has approx 19k miles and 3 prior owners.  

Some cosmetic mods but modest.

Recent oil change and brake jobs. 

Tags paid up for the year.

It appears that the PO lowsided and dropped the bike.  Although it's hard to tell.  Was PNO for 2 years before I bought it.  

Price is right, it's a Honda so it will last, and it is quite fast.

I have a 2005 Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade Repsol for sale.

Bike rides perfect, smooth on acceleration and the twisties.  

Has approx 19k miles and 3 prior owners.  

Some cosmetic mods but modest.

Recent oil change and brake jobs. 

Tags paid up for the year.

It appears that the PO lowsided and dropped the bike.  Although it's hard to tell.  Was PNO for 2 years before I bought it.  

Price is right, it's a Honda so it will last, and it is quite fast. 

Thanks for looking!

The Pirelli Scorpion tires are practically new.  I am the original owner and it has always been garage kept.  It has never been downed and has a clean title.  The registration is current until October 2018.  I'm also throwing in a carbon fiber Buell logo helmet and Buell logo armored gloves (both like new), a trickle charger, a waterproof cover, Buell logo beanie, Buell logo scarf, and a framed Buell logo emblem.  I also have some of the original parts boxed up as well.

I'm selling my motorcycle because I'm planning to travel in the near future and just haven't been riding it as much as I used to.  If you want to test ride it, you'll need to have the cash for me to hold, and a motorcycle license.  Feel free to contact me with any questions.

I have for sale a 2008 R1 with 28,198 miles. Valve adjustment has been done already so you don't have to worry about that. It runs great, feels great, looks great!

Pro's : Oil changes always on time along with the 25,000 mile maintenance done at RPM Cycles whom also did the valve adjustment. Decent thread on tires and an all around well taken care of motorcycle. Most of the miles were freeway miles from Ventura to Fillmore commute and therefore it has a Pirelli Angel tire in the back. Bike has never been down under my ownership, past owner did scratch it by running into a yellow pole. Galfer ceramic brakes with less that 5k miles on them. 

Con's : Ignition coil #1 is under spec for resistance, I am currently looking for the part which runs $100. Front lights High beams and regulars are out, the previous owner installed after market lights and because I never really rode at night I never found it necessary to look into it. Chain will eventually need to be replaced.

Not a con but oil change is coming up @ 30,000 miles. 

If you are looking for a fun, powerful and sick looking bike than you don't have to look anywhere else. If you are mechanically inclined you can I can knock down $200 that the ignition coil + labor would cost you to replace. 

I can include my Shoei GT Air Helmet which to be honest it might be good as a spare but the visor is pretty scratched as well as my Scorpion Phantom Jacket which I got when I purchased the bike so it has some good miles on it. I am 6'4 and weigh 210. 

Give me a text or email me if you have any questions,

2003 Cagiva V-Raptor

2003 CAGIVA RAPTOR a/k/a Ducati Monster 2: very rare, excellent shape!

$2899

QR Code Link to This Post


Up for sale is my 2003 Cagiva V-Raptor 1000. This model started the "praying mantis" style semi-naked bikes. I think its one of the most unique looking bikes in recent years. It's also rare: I believe there are only about 5 Cagiva Raptors in the U.S., and that this is the only V-Raptor model in the country.

History: the Cagiva Raptor was intended to be an alternative to the Ducati Monster and it was designed by the same man who penned the Monster (Galuzzi designed both since Ducati & Cagiva used to be sister companies). While the Monster has an expensive to repair and sometimes tempermental Ducati motor, Cagiva sourced a more powerful 1000 CC V-twin motor from Suzuki - the same motor as Suzuki used in their legendry 1000TL (known as a very fast bike).

Cagiva says the Suzuki motor makes about 112 HP in the V-Raptor - a lot for a bike this light. Best of all: the Suzuki motor is proven, reliable, is not expensive to get parts for if needed, and can be serviced or repaired at just about any motorcycle mechanic or Suzuki dealership. And it is the same motor as used in the Bimota SB8R. 

I bought this bike about a year ago. Since buying it, I had the tank and fairings painted matte white (painter did a good job, not perfect -- but it looks very cool). I installed a different set of bars ("Driven" brand - wider than what it came with for greater comfort). I instaled new mini mirrors and grips. I replaced the headlight bulb with a Silverstar Ultra High Performace bulb and the driving light bulb with an LED bulb.

I also relaced the pipes it came with with a brand new set of Ducati 1088 pipes. I changed the front brake reservoir, changed the brake fluid and bled front and rear brakes. I put in a new battery and clutch cable. I had the radiator pressure tested and flushed and replaced the coolant. I did an oil and filter change and changed the spark plugs (NGK). It has a pretty fresh set of matched expensive Michellin tires. 

Everything that looks like carbon fiber on the bike actually is (except the carbon looking "Cagiva" protective sticker on the engine cover). A prior owner replaced the front fender, the tank "cowls" & the side covers with real carbon parts. The tank, upper fairing and lower fairing are a PVC material material, the rear fender has been deleted, etc....not a lot of fat on this bike. The rear pillion is removeable and there is a passenger seat.

I have been wanting to get the correct front turn signals that fit in the openings in the fairing: the ones on now will work fine, but I haven't wired them up yet. I have also been looking for a new wind screen - this one has been painted matte black and looks good, but it has damage noticeable on inspection. I noticed a drop of oil under the bike last week - I did not change the crush washer when I did the oil change so that may be it.

Starts easy. Runs and shifts well. Does not smoke. All lights and horn work. 
Comes with original pipes, original bars, original mirrors, original "cowl", a box of extras and spares, etc...
48K Miles. Has valid California registration with no back due fees or penalties and a clean title in my name.

Other bikes of this generation (Italian and japanese) will just go down in value - this  one will hold and appreciate due to rarity.
$2,899

***NO SCAMMERS - I will report you. Also, I DO NOT need help selling this motorcycle*** 

Thanks...

Priced $1000 under KBB to sell fast.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll be waiting until Spring and reposting for actual MSRP.

This GSX-R goes 300kph. 190mph. This thing is F.A.S.T. and priced right if you're willing to get into that seat in the budget trim. This bike has more upgrades than I can even list. I will include F.R.E.E. extras in the sale whichever level you choose (see below)~

Clean Title. Current Registration. Starts right up. Fully Serviced. No problems. Needs Nothing. Low Miles. Ready to Canyon, Commute, or Careen at the Track.

This GSXR has Power Modes which literally turn the bike into a 600, 750, or the full 1000 beast. Push of a button, takes 2 seconds.  It's a very cool option for tight technical canyons or close-quarter lane-splitting.

Option 1: As pictured, with those $$$ Carrozzeria Wheels, Brembo Brakes, and many more goodies not seen: $7500
Option 2: Stock Wheels & Brakes, Full Two Bros Black Series & Mystery Door #2 goodies: $5500
Option 3: Don't upsale me with wheels and flashy name-brand stuff, the stock version is fast enough! $5000

Free Delivery, Just detailed the bike, or bring your pessimistic mechanic and lift her skirt in person~

The S2R has the single sided swingarm that most regular monsters did not have and it is the 1000cc version (there was a 800 s2r) honestly I  really like this bike and it is great but I have been doing more track riding and want a track bike. The bike runs great and sounds great, Houston Super Bikes tuned the ECU. Awesome bike for what ever you want to do, commuting or canyons or track it is great.

Never been able to use this line when selling one of my bikes...

Accident forces sale. Or to be more accurate - some asshole without insurance or a driver's licence hit me on my way to work and jacked up my shoulder and a year of my life.... I can't ride for another several months. Bike to good home.

2011 Honda CB1000R. 
Registered.
Clear title in hand.
I'm the second owner. Previous owner worked for American Honda, so the bike was taken care of prior to my taking possession.
28900 well cared for miles.
I purchased the bike with 12000miles on the odo. 
I've used this bike for commuting only.  No track days. Hadn't even gotten a chance to hang it out in the canyons...
4.2 gallon gas tank and I can reliably get 140miles/tank exceeding the speed limit at all times. Naked bike, no fairing = great gas mileage is what i'm saying.

Bike is buttery smooth as to be expected for a well sorted Honda inline 4. 
Arkapovic titanium muffler with carbon fiber endcap and actual mid-pipe! True 4 into 1. Not loud, no gimmicky sounding bullshit eBay exhaust. 
Power commander to manage fuel, runs great at all rpm and all angles.....
Fabbri windscreen not installed. It works. I took it off for the photos.
New Michelin Pilot Road 5 tires front and rear - not even scrubbed in yet.

As I alluded to up top. I was hit on the 405 back in May. My body took the brunt of the low speed impact. I'm still recovering from shoulder surgery. The bike was knocked out from under me.
Clutch cover was scraped. Right handlebar was scraped. Right mirror was scrapped. That's it! Bike ran when picked up. Too bad I wasn't in running condition after.
Anyway...New bars, bar ends, grips, mirrors, clutch cover, clutch cover bolts and the bike looks just as good as it did before that shithead hit me. I'm not bitter. Not at all....

You can have the take off parts if you want them. 
Not trying to hide anything. Bike runs great. 
Test ride if you have cash in hand or leave me the keys to your truck.....and a motorcycle endorsement on your license. That's actually a deal breaker for me. Go figure. Bring a helmet too because you can't borrow mine. That's just gross. And weird.

Email me your cell number, I'll text you back and you can check it out.

Great bike. I'm retired and having neck surgery so my riding days are done. Time for an RV. Only owner and only rider. Many extra's including Power Commander 5, Two Bros Pipes, Center Stand, Factory Gel Seat, Givi 43 liter top box w/ Givi mounting gear, Givi engine guards, Madstad Bracket w/ Givi tall windscreen, Battery Tender Jr and cords and for an extra $50 I'll include a pair of fleece lined Hippo Hands which are priceless in colder weather. Oh and it has heated grips as well. Cash only and I mean currency. No checks. It has been a great commuter for me and a great bike for canyons and coastal routes. It has started every time I pressed the starter without fail. I've worked in a bike shop for the last 13 years that has Suzuki as one of it's lines so you can count on it being very well maintained. Never more than 3500 between oil changes. Only Motul 5100 in the engine. Serious people only please. KBB excellent condition is $4500 but I know the miles are a bit high for some so hence the lower price. Tires are also in good shape. Michelin Pilot Road 3's with easily 10k left. I also have a spare air filter and brake pads that I'm including.
Just renewed plates. Be happy to go to AAA with you to insure smooth transfer. Please email if you have questions or would like to come and see it.
Also will include a lot of riding gear if you're a large guy like me, 6'2...250... Jackets, gloves cold pants and cold weather riding suit. Bout $1000+ of gear...

Hello CL, up for sale is this fuel injected 1000cc torque monster! 
   This bike is tastefully modified and has been adult owened and never stunted or abused. Completely updated suspension from a zx10 with the large radial mounted brakes for better stopping power rounding off the braking is a brembo RSC 19 master cylinder with steel braided brake lines with EBC HH brake pads to better clamp the rotors. Fenomenal stopping power!
Outback is the Zx10 rear shock for better handling, Dunlop q3's for better cornering. New chain kit with one tooth up outback along with a custom machined flywheel for great acceleration new Barnett clutch and clutch cable for smooth action. Rounding off the power is a FULL TITANIUM PIPE made by Mr. Kawasaki Rob "Muzzy" power commander K&N air. Filter with a custom modified air box for better air flow. That's just on tap, regularly maintained with primium motorcycle specific fluids including primium gasoline. 
   This bike is solid and very reliable.  Unfortunately the previous owner lowsided it at low speed so there is a small flat spot on the tank and road rash on the fairing it's only cosmetic flaws that does not affect the performance. I purchased this bike completely stock and modified it to my liking, those that know about motorcycles and motorcycle performance can see and appreciate the modifications. The seating position on this bike is very comfortable almost dirt bike like therefore splitting lanes on the gridlocked freeways is easy peasy! Plus the pipe sounds loud enough to warn motorists. NOW That said, serious buyers only CASH ONLY! Scammers will be ignored no trades CASH ONLY! No payments CASH ONLY! No shipping COD ONLY! NO Military shipping of any kind CASH ONLY!

For sale is my 2008 cbr 1000rr. Was my daily rider for a year and a half. From the first owner I got it from at 5k miles. I took it to the mechanic because I heard a rattling one day. They told me it was fine sand into the engine through the airbox and it'll need a new engine unfortunately. This bike was really fun and I hate to sell it like this, but I had already planned on using this bike as a downpayment on another bike and now plans have changed. All services were done on the bike. All parts work and bike still runs (mechanic said rattling will get louder the more its ridden) since everything else works that's why I am starting at a high asking price. I had also recently put new brakes and had new fork seals put onto the bike no more than 3000 miles ago. 

Someone who's willing to replace the engine will have a really fun bike on their hands. Will add pictures when possible.

Mods:

Two brothers exhaust with midpipe and fender eliminator kit (previous owner)

520 chain conversion ~5000 miles ago

Pirelli Angel GT tires ~50% tread

Aftermarket levers

Priced $1000 below KBB for quick sale.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll wait until Spring and relist at MSRP.

This GSXR1000 has a Clean California Title on hand, original matching key & spare, current registration, starts right up, the 6-speed high-compression race engine revs cleanly and smoothly (please let her warm up first) and shifts perfectly. She's FULLY serviced and will require no supplementary costs to be road worthy.

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Thanks,
Jake

2003 Silver GSX-R 1000 in pristine factory condition with no modifications. This motorcycle is exactly how it came off the show room floor. Everything is OEM down to the warning stickers. I do have some aftermarket bolt-on's if needed such as Yoshimura RS-3 Titanium Exhaust, SATO Quick Release Tank Pins, Fender Eliminator Kit, Mini Blinkers, Etc.. There is only 7k miles on the bike and it runs perfect. All maintenance has been meticulously done and it needs nothing. Clean title in hand with 2 keys and a passenger seat.

Clean Title
Willing to negiotiate
The bike is $2400 because there is a ticking noise and I don't have the money to chase this issue and pay for it.
I put all my love into this bike and I'm sad to have to get rid of it for college.
This bike has had maintenance whenever it needed it.
Below is a list of important factors about this bike:
Brand new cam chain tensioner, oil, and oil filter. I rode the bike home 2 miles and haven't rode it since the shop did this.
Brand new clutch cable replaced after it broke.
The entire front triple tree was ripped out and replaced.
Relatively new front and bike Michelin Road 5 tires.
Brand new front rotors.
Upgraded suspension.
Adjustable brake lever.
Upgraded sprocket (2 teeth down in the front, 3 teeth up in the back).

I'm sure there's more I'm leaving out, but contact me if you have any questions about the bike.

Bike rides perfect, smooth on acceleration and the twisties.  

Has approx 19k miles and 3 prior owners.  

Some cosmetic mods but modest.

Recent oil change and brake jobs. 

Tags paid up for the year.

It appears that the PO lowsided and dropped the bike.  Although it's hard to tell.  Was PNO for 2 years before I bought it.  

Price is right, it's a Honda so it will last, and it is quite fast. 

Thanks for looking!

I have for sale a 2008 R1 with 28,198 miles. Valve adjustment has been done already so you don't have to worry about that. It runs great, feels great, looks great!

Pro's : Oil changes always on time along with the 25,000 mile maintenance done at RPM Cycles whom also did the valve adjustment. Decent thread on tires and an all around well taken care of motorcycle. Most of the miles were freeway miles from Ventura to Fillmore commute and therefore it has a Pirelli Angel tire in the back. Bike has never been down under my ownership, past owner did scratch it by running into a yellow pole. Galfer ceramic brakes with less that 5k miles on them. 

Con's : Ignition coil #1 is under spec for resistance, I am currently looking for the part which runs $100. Front lights High beams and regulars are out, the previous owner installed after market lights and because I never really rode at night I never found it necessary to look into it. Chain will eventually need to be replaced.

Not a con but oil change is coming up @ 30,000 miles. 

If you are looking for a fun, powerful and sick looking bike than you don't have to look anywhere else. If you are mechanically inclined you can I can knock down $200 that the ignition coil + labor would cost you to replace. 

I can include my Shoei GT Air Helmet which to be honest it might be good as a spare but the visor is pretty scratched as well as my Scorpion Phantom Jacket which I got when I purchased the bike so it has some good miles on it. I am 6'4 and weigh 210. 

Give me a text or email me if you have any questions,

It has some aftermarket features, including custom fairings, custom rear sets, and a few other things. This bike is street legal, with current registration till May, 2019. I'm motivated to sell, so will consider any REASONABLE offer. For a quick sale I'm asking $5000 or best offer. Test ride with collateral (cash or otherwise) and a valid M1 class license only.

2006 Yamaha R1 with 5,031 miles -$5000- Clean with lots of goodies

$5000

QR Code Link to This Post


I am selling a 2006 Yamaha R1 with 5031 miles.  It used to be a dedicated track bike, which is why it has such low mileage.  It has a clean title and is Non-OP'd, so it can easily be converted back to a street bike if wanted.  The bike comes with an extra, brand new set of Bridgestone BT002's.  This bike is in near immaculate condition and was extremely well maintained.   

THE GOOD:

-Termignoni full Titanium exhaust
-Ohlins steering damper 
-Cycle Cat upper triple clamp 
-Cycle Cat rearsets
-BMC air filter 
-Harris upper/front fairing stay
-Motovation frame and rear axle sliders
-Rizoma brake fluid reservoirs 
-Carbon fiber exhaust shields
-SS brake lines
-LOW MILEAGE
-free set of tires.  Bridgestone BT002's

THE BAD:
-the only negative with this bike is it was lowsided at Thunderhill in turn 11.  It has a dent in the gas tank as a result, and some wear on the left side frame slider and air duct.  please see pics.  only cosmetic damage.


No lowballers.  No test rides without cash in hand and a valid M1.

A lot of bike for the money. Some cosmetic issues, paint scratches, dent in fuel tank. All due to minor low side. The bike is mechanically sound, a fantastic ride with great suspension, tons of power and great brakes. Year 2007, Yamaha corrected fuel injection mapping issues, throttle response is perfect. New brake pads, tires have plenty of tread, ( new Bridgestone rear tire, and set of spark plugs included). I am a 76 year old rider. The bike has been well maintained, no track days, never abused. Only selling because of spouse's  anxiety issues.
   Some extras: adjustable levers, GYTR carbon exhaust, tail cleanup, flush led turn signals, Yamaha comfy gel seat. Some riding apparel available.

  This bike is in Immaculate condition and runs well. It has 3,500 miles and is slowly climbing. There's only 150 produced for the US and this may be the the nicest one around in this color scheme. It's time to pass this beauty on for someone else to enjoy. The registration is current and it's ready to ride. I'm asking $9,000

May TRADE for another bike of equal value with low miles. Bikes of interest are BMW, Yamaha FZ1, Ducati Multistrada, kawasaki, Aprilia, Honda VFR Interceptor, looking for a good Two up Bike. Adventure bike.  I'm not interested in a project bike or any junk with issues.

I dont have to sell this bike, I love it, but I have too many vehicles, and too many projects, with too little time.
I ride this to work every few days, its got fresh gas, and has been ridden regularly. not sitting around.
Changed the oil last week, Plenty of tread on both tires, Rides and handles excellent!
Comes with the tank bag pictured, and some extra parts, my helmet, jacket, everything.
These bikes are known for magnets breaking loose on the crank magneto and I have a new replacement with gasket in case this happens. Custom USB port on dash with built in volt meter installed so you can monitor the charging voltage to know when this is starting.

If you want to test drive it, bring cash, while you are test riding it, Im holding your $3000. you crash it, you bought it.
Title is clean, 49 state bike, reg is current.

Price is firm, but partial trades will be considered.

Wonderful beast. I bought this bike immediately after hearing the engine start - the sound is fantastic. The adjustable shock (from 'S' model) is nice to have... I keep it stiff when riding solo and ease it up when adding a passenger.

First owner rode til about 18,000 miles, then I bought it in 2013 and rode to current mileage, which is around 41,500. She is still in great condition, though with the minor scuffs you'd expect. Garage parked, no accidents.

Mods:
- I installed the Givi top case, which is specifically the V47NT Tech Black 47 Litre Monokey model. It holds two full face helmets and is easy to remove from bike when not needed.
- Sargent seat and tinted touring screen put on by previous owner.
- Lights, bars, exhaust are all stock.

Maintenance has been regular and last service was done less than 2000 miles ago. Here are some recent replacements:
- Front and rear tires have less than 1500 miles, currently Angel GTs. Front fork seals replaced, rear brake pad replaced, and chain serviced at same time.
- Full annual service done about 9 months ago, including oil service, chain adjust, fluids check, and safety inspection.
- Battery is good and she starts quickly, usually after one or two turns of the engine.

I had Munroe do a Used Bike inspection report which I can share as well. It shows that all is well with the bike, esp. mechanically. A Vehicle History Report from VINCheckup.com is also available showing no accidents, liens, etc.

Most service done at Munroe, some at Desmoto. Registration good until early 2019.
Title in hand.

Up for sale is my 2012 BMW S1000RR. 
If you know how to work on bikes, don't miss out on this opportunity. As you can see the bike needs a few parts replaced but I've got a list of everything and it's going to be about $3000 to get it back in good shape.
This bike is an absolute BEAST ! Untouchable on the streets. It's a very rare color which was only made in 2012, its called fire blue. The bike has 24,xxx miles on it and still holds a clean title. This bike originally sold for $22,000. It's 200 HP at the rear wheel and 200 mph whenever you want it. The bike is dyno tuned with a Power Commander 5 and AERO exhaust . It's got Abs and traction control ! Also 4 different power settings accessible on the fly. (Slick)(rain)(Sport)(RACE) each unleash different levels of riders assists. It comes with Ohlins 10 way adjustable suspension & BREMBO brakes.
Most people dont know but this bike also comes with the electronic quick shift feature from the factory. (Sounds amazing when you're going through the gears)
·Motor and transmission are in tip top shape
The bike will come with everything you see including 
- Power commander 5
- Carbon Fiber AERO exhaust
- Fully adjustable VORTEX rear sets
- Adjustable levers
- Yoshimura license plate kit with LED light
- Brand New soft compound rear tire
- Brand new Galfer rear brakes

Here's what it needs

· Fork assembly $1350
· Front Intake assembly $25
· Headlight Bracket $45
· Front rim $230
· Rear rim $300
· Left side / front fairings $400
· Radiator $405
· Oil cooler $240

I have managed to find all the parts online. I just dont have time to work on the bike so I'm going to cut ties with it. My loss is your gain. There is money to be made on this thing. The motor alone is worth $2500. Transmission is worth another $2500. Even the gas tank is worth $1500


Im asking $2500 firm for the bike. After it's fixed this bike is worth over $9k so there's still plenty of room for profit. 
If interested call or text me at  show contact info

A great sport-touring chassis, muscular 997cc Ninja®-inspired In-line Four engine, big 7.5-gallon fuel tank and detachable hard bags. Steer the Concours up a winding touring road just once, and you'll wish you had discovered it earlier.

When it comes to sport-touring, it doesn't get much better than the Kawasaki Concours™ motorcycle. The bike is equipped with a sportbike-style fairing that offers ample wind protection, and hard saddlebags for loads of carrying capacity, and there's the added benefit of the Concours™ power and handling ability that is on par with the NINJA® sportbikes.

Hey everyone!

Up for sale is my Aprilia Tuono, it's the half year so there's some slight power gain and different front brakes.

History:
As far as I know, I'm the second owner, previous owner downed it, I replaced all necessary parts to get it in running condition but there are still some scratches on the bike but they are minor.

I removed some of the decals due to it being faded and I just haven't gotten around to buying a new set to replace them.

Title is clean.
Current Miles: 15,xxx

Parts Replaced:
Air Duct
Left Headlight

Services:
-I have service records which includes a valve adjustment which I did myself. I'll be more than happy to provide all proof of documentation as request! 
-Most recent service was an oil change and changing out the rear brake pads along with re-bleeding it. 06/30/18

Misc:
-Leo Vince Slip ons (Will include stock exhaust)
-Metzler Roadtech Z8 tires
-New Battery (Replaced as of 06/30/18)
-EK MVXZ2 Series 520 Chain
-Driven Race sprockets 15 tooth front/ 40 tooth rear 

Price: Looking for $4800 OBO! 
Preferably no trades, but only trade I would consider is a KTM 390 Duke
Thanks!

Ducati ST4S, like new condition 16,000 miles. I know the history from the first owner (from Palo Alto area) and I do have original red key, red code number, and extra key. It was just tuned up, valves etc. and all the services are up to date. Services were done at Nichol's and Advanced Cysle Service. It just got new tires, new brake pads, new front shocks (there was an oil leak), new chain. It has a lot of extras:

- Sergant leather seat (+ original seat)
- Bar risers
- Throttle lock
- Two extra windshields (+ original Ducati)
- camera installed
- extra power outlets
- Frame sliders
- Front axle sliders
- Givi monolock top case
- Side mirrors with integrated signals (+ original ones)

There are no scratches nor dents. There is only a very small crack at the side frame at the screw, hardly visible (shown in pictures)

This is a fast bike 117hp, fun and sporty but comfortable for a long ride. A true sport touring bike. They do not make it any longer and this was the best Ducati model in this category.

Why am I selling it? I am getting too old to ride. It is risky.  This is a crazy good deal on this bike. Don't be fooled by the low price. It's an awesome deal and an awesome bike, with pedigre.

Cash and your valid M1 license in my hand, if you want a test drive. Serious inquires only. No tire kickers. No asking what is my lowest price. It is what you see. No offerings for MotoFax, I know the trick.

2005 Kawasaki Concours ZG1000

4 cylinder engine, liquid cooled, disk brakes (dual in front).  There are tons of sites online with information about this bike and specs if you want to check them out.

I bought this from the original owner back in 2011.  It's a great bike.  Although I never thought I would sell this bike, I simply do not ride anymore and need to be practical.  This bike is amazingly reliable - in my 7 years of ownership, I don't think I have done anything but maintenance type work (nothing breaks).

Bike just had the carburetor taken apart and cleaned and got a clean bill of health.  Runs very well and so much fun to drive.  The bike is very comfortable and great for long road trips which is primarily what the first owner and I used it for (thus the included accessories outlined below).  

Aftermarket accessories included (installed on bike):
1) Givi trunk
2) Handlebar risers (allow you to position yourself a little more straight up (rather than forward) - must for long rides)
3) Throttle lock (for a cruise control-like experience) and matching end cap for other handlebar
4) 12V cigarette lighter adapter in dash
5) Aux power lead to battery (to connect battery tender or battery powered bike suit)

First pic is stock, the others are recent pics of the actual bike.  While not shown in all the pics, the side bags come with the bike.

Whether your journey takes you up twisty mountain roads, to busy city centers or on your daily commute, the Multistrada excels wherever there is asphalt. When the engineers at Ducati responded to their design brief with the beautiful and practical 2004 Ducati 1000DS Multistrada, they produced an almost perfect amalgam of high performance sportbike engineering and upright enduro versatility. The Multistrada addresses the fact that on real world roads we are just as likely to encounter battered uneven asphalt as we are glass smooth thoroughfares. The joy of riding the Ducati Multistrada is in the bike's ability to deliver impressive performance on several fronts. Whether it is the juggernaut of a daily commute, or the freedom of the open road as part of a weekend getaway, the Italian mount is at heart what we all want a motorcycle to be fun.

Up for sale is my '07 R1 sport bike. It has been regularly maintained with synthetic Mobil 1 racing 4T motor oil only. This bike has <15k on the clock. The fork suspension has just been serviced, with new seals, boots, and oil. The gearing has been changed from OEM to a "power up" configuration, shifting the power band to a more effective, user-friendly (and much more fun) range. This bike has a wet weight of 480 lbs, and has 156 base horsepower. It has Michelin Pilot Power 2CT tires (my favorite for this kind of bike) with plenty of meat left on em. It has some aftermarket features, including custom fairings, custom rear sets, and a few other things. This bike is street legal, with current registration till May, 2019. I'm motivated to sell, so will consider any REASONABLE offer. For a quick sale I'm asking $5000 or best offer. Test ride with collateral (cash or otherwise) and a valid M1 class license only.

2006 Yamaha R1 with 5,031 miles -$5000- Clean with lots of goodies

$5000

QR Code Link to This Post


I am selling a 2006 Yamaha R1 with 5031 miles.  It used to be a dedicated track bike, which is why it has such low mileage.  It has a clean title and is Non-OP'd, so it can easily be converted back to a street bike if wanted.  The bike comes with an extra, brand new set of Bridgestone BT002's.  This bike is in near immaculate condition and was extremely well maintained.   

THE GOOD:

-Termignoni full Titanium exhaust
-Ohlins steering damper 
-Cycle Cat upper triple clamp 
-Cycle Cat rearsets
-BMC air filter 
-Harris upper/front fairing stay
-Motovation frame and rear axle sliders
-Rizoma brake fluid reservoirs 
-Carbon fiber exhaust shields
-SS brake lines
-LOW MILEAGE
-free set of tires.  Bridgestone BT002's

THE BAD:
-the only negative with this bike is it was lowsided at Thunderhill in turn 11.  It has a dent in the gas tank as a result, and some wear on the left side frame slider and air duct.  please see pics.  only cosmetic damage.


No lowballers.  No test rides without cash in hand and a valid M1.

I have for sale a 2008 R1 with 28,198 miles. Valve adjustment has been done already so you don't have to worry about that. It runs great, feels great, looks great!

Pro's : Oil changes always on time along with the 25,000 mile maintenance done at RPM Cycles whom also did the valve adjustment. Decent thread on tires and an all around well taken care of motorcycle. Most of the miles were freeway miles from Ventura to Fillmore commute and therefore it has a Pirelli Angel tire in the back. Bike has never been down under my ownership, past owner did scratch it by running into a yellow pole. Galfer ceramic brakes with less that 5k miles on them. 

Con's : Ignition coil #1 is under spec for resistance, I am currently looking for the part which runs $100. Front lights High beams and regulars are out, the previous owner installed after market lights and because I never really rode at night I never found it necessary to look into it. Chain will eventually need to be replaced.

Not a con but oil change is coming up @ 30,000 miles. 

If you are looking for a fun, powerful and sick looking bike than you don't have to look anywhere else. If you are mechanically inclined you can I can knock down $200 that the ignition coil + labor would cost you to replace. 

I can include my Shoei GT Air Helmet which to be honest it might be good as a spare but the visor is pretty scratched as well as my Scorpion Phantom Jacket which I got when I purchased the bike so it has some good miles on it. I am 6'4 and weigh 210. 

Give me a text or email me if you have any questions,

2003 Cagiva V-Raptor

2003 CAGIVA RAPTOR a/k/a Ducati Monster 2: very rare, excellent shape!

$2899

QR Code Link to This Post


Up for sale is my 2003 Cagiva V-Raptor 1000. This model started the "praying mantis" style semi-naked bikes. I think its one of the most unique looking bikes in recent years. It's also rare: I believe there are only about 5 Cagiva Raptors in the U.S., and that this is the only V-Raptor model in the country.

History: the Cagiva Raptor was intended to be an alternative to the Ducati Monster and it was designed by the same man who penned the Monster (Galuzzi designed both since Ducati & Cagiva used to be sister companies). While the Monster has an expensive to repair and sometimes tempermental Ducati motor, Cagiva sourced a more powerful 1000 CC V-twin motor from Suzuki - the same motor as Suzuki used in their legendry 1000TL (known as a very fast bike).

Cagiva says the Suzuki motor makes about 112 HP in the V-Raptor - a lot for a bike this light. Best of all: the Suzuki motor is proven, reliable, is not expensive to get parts for if needed, and can be serviced or repaired at just about any motorcycle mechanic or Suzuki dealership. And it is the same motor as used in the Bimota SB8R. 

I bought this bike about a year ago. Since buying it, I had the tank and fairings painted matte white (painter did a good job, not perfect -- but it looks very cool). I installed a different set of bars ("Driven" brand - wider than what it came with for greater comfort). I instaled new mini mirrors and grips. I replaced the headlight bulb with a Silverstar Ultra High Performace bulb and the driving light bulb with an LED bulb.

I also relaced the pipes it came with with a brand new set of Ducati 1088 pipes. I changed the front brake reservoir, changed the brake fluid and bled front and rear brakes. I put in a new battery and clutch cable. I had the radiator pressure tested and flushed and replaced the coolant. I did an oil and filter change and changed the spark plugs (NGK). It has a pretty fresh set of matched expensive Michellin tires. 

Everything that looks like carbon fiber on the bike actually is (except the carbon looking "Cagiva" protective sticker on the engine cover). A prior owner replaced the front fender, the tank "cowls" & the side covers with real carbon parts. The tank, upper fairing and lower fairing are a PVC material material, the rear fender has been deleted, etc....not a lot of fat on this bike. The rear pillion is removeable and there is a passenger seat.

I have been wanting to get the correct front turn signals that fit in the openings in the fairing: the ones on now will work fine, but I haven't wired them up yet. I have also been looking for a new wind screen - this one has been painted matte black and looks good, but it has damage noticeable on inspection. I noticed a drop of oil under the bike last week - I did not change the crush washer when I did the oil change so that may be it.

Starts easy. Runs and shifts well. Does not smoke. All lights and horn work. 
Comes with original pipes, original bars, original mirrors, original "cowl", a box of extras and spares, etc...
48K Miles. Has valid California registration with no back due fees or penalties and a clean title in my name.

Other bikes of this generation (Italian and japanese) will just go down in value - this  one will hold and appreciate due to rarity.
$2,899

***NO SCAMMERS - I will report you. Also, I DO NOT need help selling this motorcycle*** 

Thanks...

Priced $1000 under KBB to sell fast.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll be waiting until Spring and reposting for actual MSRP.

This GSX-R goes 300kph. 190mph. This thing is F.A.S.T. and priced right if you're willing to get into that seat in the budget trim. This bike has more upgrades than I can even list. I will include F.R.E.E. extras in the sale whichever level you choose (see below)~

Clean Title. Current Registration. Starts right up. Fully Serviced. No problems. Needs Nothing. Low Miles. Ready to Canyon, Commute, or Careen at the Track.

This GSXR has Power Modes which literally turn the bike into a 600, 750, or the full 1000 beast. Push of a button, takes 2 seconds.  It's a very cool option for tight technical canyons or close-quarter lane-splitting.

Option 1: As pictured, with those $$$ Carrozzeria Wheels, Brembo Brakes, and many more goodies not seen: $7500
Option 2: Stock Wheels & Brakes, Full Two Bros Black Series & Mystery Door #2 goodies: $5500
Option 3: Don't upsale me with wheels and flashy name-brand stuff, the stock version is fast enough! $5000

Free Delivery, Just detailed the bike, or bring your pessimistic mechanic and lift her skirt in person~

Awesome 2007 Ducati Monster S2R 1000 up for sale. The S2R has the single sided swingarm that most regular monsters did not have and it is the 1000cc version (there was a 800 s2r) honestly I  really like this bike and it is great but I have been doing more track riding and want a track bike. The bike runs great and sounds great, Houston Super Bikes tuned the ECU. Awesome bike for what ever you want to do, commuting or canyons or track it is great.

Never been able to use this line when selling one of my bikes...

Accident forces sale. Or to be more accurate - some asshole without insurance or a driver's licence hit me on my way to work and jacked up my shoulder and a year of my life.... I can't ride for another several months. Bike to good home.

2011 Honda CB1000R. 
Registered.
Clear title in hand.
I'm the second owner. Previous owner worked for American Honda, so the bike was taken care of prior to my taking possession.
28900 well cared for miles.
I purchased the bike with 12000miles on the odo. 
I've used this bike for commuting only.  No track days. Hadn't even gotten a chance to hang it out in the canyons...
4.2 gallon gas tank and I can reliably get 140miles/tank exceeding the speed limit at all times. Naked bike, no fairing = great gas mileage is what i'm saying.

Bike is buttery smooth as to be expected for a well sorted Honda inline 4. 
Arkapovic titanium muffler with carbon fiber endcap and actual mid-pipe! True 4 into 1. Not loud, no gimmicky sounding bullshit eBay exhaust. 
Power commander to manage fuel, runs great at all rpm and all angles.....
Fabbri windscreen not installed. It works. I took it off for the photos.
New Michelin Pilot Road 5 tires front and rear - not even scrubbed in yet.

As I alluded to up top. I was hit on the 405 back in May. My body took the brunt of the low speed impact. I'm still recovering from shoulder surgery. The bike was knocked out from under me.
Clutch cover was scraped. Right handlebar was scraped. Right mirror was scrapped. That's it! Bike ran when picked up. Too bad I wasn't in running condition after.
Anyway...New bars, bar ends, grips, mirrors, clutch cover, clutch cover bolts and the bike looks just as good as it did before that shithead hit me. I'm not bitter. Not at all....

You can have the take off parts if you want them. 
Not trying to hide anything. Bike runs great. 
Test ride if you have cash in hand or leave me the keys to your truck.....and a motorcycle endorsement on your license. That's actually a deal breaker for me. Go figure. Bring a helmet too because you can't borrow mine. That's just gross. And weird.

Email me your cell number, I'll text you back and you can check it out.

Great bike. I'm retired and having neck surgery so my riding days are done. Time for an RV. Only owner and only rider. Many extra's including Power Commander 5, Two Bros Pipes, Center Stand, Factory Gel Seat, Givi 43 liter top box w/ Givi mounting gear, Givi engine guards, Madstad Bracket w/ Givi tall windscreen, Battery Tender Jr and cords and for an extra $50 I'll include a pair of fleece lined Hippo Hands which are priceless in colder weather. Oh and it has heated grips as well. Cash only and I mean currency. No checks. It has been a great commuter for me and a great bike for canyons and coastal routes. It has started every time I pressed the starter without fail. I've worked in a bike shop for the last 13 years that has Suzuki as one of it's lines so you can count on it being very well maintained. Never more than 3500 between oil changes. Only Motul 5100 in the engine. Serious people only please. KBB excellent condition is $4500 but I know the miles are a bit high for some so hence the lower price. Tires are also in good shape. Michelin Pilot Road 3's with easily 10k left. I also have a spare air filter and brake pads that I'm including.
Just renewed plates. Be happy to go to AAA with you to insure smooth transfer. Please email if you have questions or would like to come and see it.
Also will include a lot of riding gear if you're a large guy like me, 6'2...250... Jackets, gloves cold pants and cold weather riding suit. Bout $1000+ of gear...

Hello CL, up for sale is this fuel injected 1000cc torque monster! 
   This bike is tastefully modified and has been adult owened and never stunted or abused. Completely updated suspension from a zx10 with the large radial mounted brakes for better stopping power rounding off the braking is a brembo RSC 19 master cylinder with steel braided brake lines with EBC HH brake pads to better clamp the rotors. Fenomenal stopping power!
Outback is the Zx10 rear shock for better handling, Dunlop q3's for better cornering. New chain kit with one tooth up outback along with a custom machined flywheel for great acceleration new Barnett clutch and clutch cable for smooth action. Rounding off the power is a FULL TITANIUM PIPE made by Mr. Kawasaki Rob "Muzzy" power commander K&N air. Filter with a custom modified air box for better air flow. That's just on tap, regularly maintained with primium motorcycle specific fluids including primium gasoline. 
   This bike is solid and very reliable.  Unfortunately the previous owner lowsided it at low speed so there is a small flat spot on the tank and road rash on the fairing it's only cosmetic flaws that does not affect the performance. I purchased this bike completely stock and modified it to my liking, those that know about motorcycles and motorcycle performance can see and appreciate the modifications. The seating position on this bike is very comfortable almost dirt bike like therefore splitting lanes on the gridlocked freeways is easy peasy! Plus the pipe sounds loud enough to warn motorists. NOW That said, serious buyers only CASH ONLY! Scammers will be ignored no trades CASH ONLY! No payments CASH ONLY! No shipping COD ONLY! NO Military shipping of any kind CASH ONLY!

For sale is my 2008 cbr 1000rr. Was my daily rider for a year and a half. From the first owner I got it from at 5k miles. I took it to the mechanic because I heard a rattling one day. They told me it was fine sand into the engine through the airbox and it'll need a new engine unfortunately. This bike was really fun and I hate to sell it like this, but I had already planned on using this bike as a downpayment on another bike and now plans have changed. All services were done on the bike. All parts work and bike still runs (mechanic said rattling will get louder the more its ridden) since everything else works that's why I am starting at a high asking price. I had also recently put new brakes and had new fork seals put onto the bike no more than 3000 miles ago. 

Someone who's willing to replace the engine will have a really fun bike on their hands. Will add pictures when possible.

Mods:

Two brothers exhaust with midpipe and fender eliminator kit (previous owner)

520 chain conversion ~5000 miles ago

Pirelli Angel GT tires ~50% tread

Aftermarket levers

Priced $1000 below KBB for quick sale.  If she doesn't sell in the next month I'll wait until Spring and relist at MSRP.

This GSXR1000 has a Clean California Title on hand, original matching key & spare, current registration, starts right up, the 6-speed high-compression race engine revs cleanly and smoothly (please let her warm up first) and shifts perfectly. She's FULLY serviced and will require no supplementary costs to be road worthy.

This GSX-R has power modes which literally turns the output into a 100hp/600cc, 130hp/750cc, or 170hp/1000cc beast. You have the choice to ride a 600 all the way to a 1000 on a daily basis depending how you feel. I'll link an article at the bottom to show the modes & dyno analysis.

This hot blonde still wears its OEM Suzuki Fairings (super rare to not garnish the melty China alternatives), Super low miles, fully serviced, & can be both ridden on a test drive and home. Too many upgrades to list or even notice, although we can play on the price depending on what options you want~

Pick Your Trim!
1) $7500 as seen in the photos (with the Carrozzeria Race Wheels, Brembo Brakes, a Full Two Bros Exhaust, and some super rare race mods not photographed. Recently a similarly equipped motorcycle sold for $10k on eBay, it's the red '08.
2) $5500 with stock wheels & brakes, Full Two Brothers Exhaust included in sale (and more free race mods)
3) $5000 in budget & stock form, you'll get some upgrades but the wheels are super big ticket items I'd rather sell separately

Thanks,
Jake

The S2R has the single sided swingarm that most regular monsters did not have and it is the 1000cc version (there was a 800 s2r) honestly I really like this bike and it is great but I have been doing more track riding and want a track bike. The bike runs great and sounds great, Houston Super Bikes tuned the ECU. Awesome bike for what ever you want to do, commuting or canyons or track it is great.

Clean Title
Willing to negiotiate
The bike is $2400 because there is a ticking noise and I don't have the money to chase this issue and pay for it.
I put all my love into this bike and I'm sad to have to get rid of it for college.
This bike has had maintenance whenever it needed it.
Below is a list of important factors about this bike:
Brand new cam chain tensioner, oil, and oil filter. I rode the bike home 2 miles and haven't rode it since the shop did this.
Brand new clutch cable replaced after it broke.
The entire front triple tree was ripped out and replaced.
Relatively new front and bike Michelin Road 5 tires.
Brand new front rotors.
Upgraded suspension.
Adjustable brake lever.
Upgraded sprocket (2 teeth down in the front, 3 teeth up in the back).

I'm sure there's more I'm leaving out, but contact me if you have any questions about the bike.

2005 Kawasaki Concours - ZG1000

$1300

QR Code Link to This Post


Hello Everyone, 

I'm selling my 2005 Kawasaki Concours, ZG 1000. 

I love this bike, but I need to sell it. It has one main issue which is why I'm selling for $1300 OBO. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY! Issue listed below.

Like most sport-touring models, this bike has a comfortable seat and is a nice ride with good acceleration. The bike has about 25k miles on it. I've kept and maintained it since I've owned it over the past 2-3 years. I've worked on it myself, but have also taken it in to be serviced at a dealer. 

This bike is great for commuting; It used to be my daily driver for my commute to school and work. I could pack all I needed for the day in my saddle bags and on the luggage rack. The ride is comfortable and still has power when you need it. 

Cosmetic/ Accessories:
1. (2) front pockets 
2. Speakers with AUX cable in front-left pocket
3. 12V receptacle; works with car charger adapters, I use it to charge my phone or iPod when I have my music going.
4. (2) hard-shelled saddle bags
5. Handle bar throttle-lock cruise control
6. Passenger back-rest
7. Small luggage rack base
8. I'm including the recently bought hex-head bolts to replace most of the factory installed ones and the service manual


Maintenance:
1. Recent oil/filter change (About 3 months ago)
2. Coolant flush/replacement
3. Rebuilt master/slave clutch cylinders
4. New front brake pads
5. New rear brake pads (need to be installed)
6. Cleaned out the carburetors when I first bought it
7. Fairly new tires with plenty of tread left

Needs work:
1. The acceleration isn't always there. From the feel of the throttle, it may need to have the clutch disks replaced. (This is why I am selling it; as a student and being recently engaged I can't put any money in to the bike)
2. small oil drip at the oil pan bolt; bought a new washer to be installed, but I haven't installed it because I wanted to buy a magnetic oil pan bolt.
3. Some scratches on the fairings; cracked plastics near the right turn signal.
4. Cracked left mirror

Besides these things, everything works fine. 

NOTE: THE BIKE RUNS AND RIDES, BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TO FIND A WAY TO TRANSPORT IT AS PER THE ISSUE LISTED ABOVE

If all this sounds good to you, feel free to email or send a text to (nine zero nine) two six zero - eight six two five AGAIN, ONLY SERIOUS INQUIRES! I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME. I AM OFTEN BUSY FROM 6:30AM-8PM WEEKDAYS SO WEEKENDS ARE THE BEST TIME TO LOOK AT THE BIKE. I will respond more quickly to text, so text is preferred!

Very rare - less than 100 sold in the US.

Weighs only 416 pounds. Stock exhaust has been replaced with dual stainless-steel canisters by Remus with carbon-fiber heat shields.

Runs great. Always garaged. Never dropped. Adult owned. Still out-handles almost any other bike in its class. Brand new clutch. Less than 1k miles on Pirelli Angel GT tires. Have all receipts. Too many bikes in the stable. Really sad to see this one go. $3,900. Test rides ok (provided you have cash in hand, Class M license, and insurance.) Scammers go away. This ain't my first rodeo. Eight-oh-Five, 45nine, oh 8 seven six. Call or text preferred.

A lot of bike for the money. Some cosmetic issues, paint scratches, dent in fuel tank. All due to minor low side. The bike is mechanically sound, a fantastic ride with great suspension, tons of power and great brakes. Year 2007, Yamaha corrected fuel injection mapping issues, throttle response is perfect. New brake pads, tires have plenty of tread, ( new Bridgestone rear tire, and set of spark plugs included). I am a 76 year old rider. The bike has been well maintained, no track days, never abused. Only selling because of spouse's  anxiety issues.
   Some extras: adjustable levers, GYTR carbon exhaust, tail cleanup, flush led turn signals, Yamaha comfy gel seat. Some riding apparel available.

Up for sale is my '07 R1 sport bike. It has been regularly maintained with synthetic Mobil 1 racing 4T motor oil only. This bike has <15k on the clock. The fork suspension has just been serviced, with new seals, boots, and oil. The gearing has been changed from OEM to a "power up" configuration, shifting the power band to a more effective, user-friendly (and much more fun) range. This bike has a wet weight of 480 lbs, and has 156 base horsepower. It has Michelin Pilot Power 2CT tires (my favorite for this kind of bike) with plenty of meat left on em. It has some aftermarket features, including custom fairings, custom rear sets, and a few other things. This bike is street legal, with current registration till May, 2019. I'm motivated to sell, so will consider any REASONABLE offer. For a quick sale I'm asking $5000 or best offer. Test ride with collateral (cash or otherwise) and a valid M1 class license only.

I am selling a 2006 Yamaha R1 with 5031 miles.  It used to be a dedicated track bike, which is why it has such low mileage.  It has a clean title and is Non-OP'd, so it can easily be converted back to a street bike if wanted.  The bike comes with an extra, brand new set of Bridgestone BT002's.  This bike is in near immaculate condition and was extremely well maintained.   

THE GOOD:

-Termignoni full Titanium exhaust
-Ohlins steering damper 
-Cycle Cat upper triple clamp 
-Cycle Cat rearsets
-BMC air filter 
-Harris upper/front fairing stay
-Motovation frame and rear axle sliders
-Rizoma brake fluid reservoirs 
-Carbon fiber exhaust shields
-SS brake lines
-LOW MILEAGE
-free set of tires.  Bridgestone BT002's

THE BAD:
-the only negative with this bike is it was lowsided at Thunderhill in turn 11.  It has a dent in the gas tank as a result, and some wear on the left side frame slider and air duct.  please see pics.  only cosmetic damage.


No lowballers.  No test rides without cash in hand and a valid M1.

For sale is my 2006 CBR 1000RR. It has 19,600 miles. Clean title. Front fork seals were just done. Brand new tires with less than 100 miles on them. This bike has a 2 brothers exhaust. All brakes were replaced with the tires and forks. I have paper work to show for it. Has steel braided brake lines all around. Custom brake and clutch levers. This bike rides like a dream and I hate to get rid of it, it's just too much bike for me unfortunately. First 4,600 cash takes it. Only trade I am interested in will be a snowmobile 800cc minimum. Thank you for looking! I have the stock exhaust to be put back on or go with the bike as well.

Whether your journey takes you up twisty mountain roads, to busy city centers or on your daily commute, the Multistrada excels wherever there is asphalt. When the engineers at Ducati responded to their design brief with the beautiful and practical 2004 Ducati 1000DS Multistrada, they produced an almost perfect amalgam of high performance sportbike engineering and upright enduro versatility. The Multistrada addresses the fact that on real world roads we are just as likely to encounter battered uneven asphalt as we are glass smooth thoroughfares. The joy of riding the Ducati Multistrada is in the bike's ability to deliver impressive performance on several fronts. Whether it is the juggernaut of a daily commute, or the freedom of the open road as part of a weekend getaway, the Italian mount is at heart what we all want a motorcycle to be fun.

Selling my bike that needs to be ridden. Haven't ridden it in almost 2 years. Needs a battery, seat cover replaced ( seat got left outside during a hail storm while out of town) and front fender (pushed against the tire at a high speed so the tire rubbed through the center of it). Has been stretched 11" lowering links, dropped front, iridium windscreen, Lamborghini orancio borealis ppg paint. Paint job was $2000. Dunlop Q3 tires with less than 1000 miles on em. This bike gets attention everywhere it gets ridden. You won't be disappointed. Rode between Cheyenne to Denver enough to rack up 10,000 miles. Time for someone else to enjoy it.

Great bike, just don't ride much anymore. Tons of extras and mechanically perfect. Engine professionally rebuilt and bored over about 5k miles ago. Power commander V, shorty levers, new sprockets and chain, drag bar (way more comfortable to ride), hot bodies full exhaust, Dunlop Q3 tires with not a lot of miles on them, rear cowl included, rear stand included, blue lights on the underbelly, brakes are good, factory recalls are taken care of. If I kept it, I'd probably replace the fairings. They look good, they're just not perfect anymore. 

Cash in hand if you want to ride it. It's a seriously fast bike. Text is preferred during the day cause I'm at work. No trades please.

Many upgrades including: Custom chameleon flake style paint, custom skull details on Suzuki logos, shortened exhausts, eliminator front and rear turn signals, brand new street tires, aftermarket levers, grips, bubble windscreen, and extended side mirrors. 

***Bike had to be re-keyed in the past so there is no tank or rear seat lock installed. Tank shuts completely and be can be opened by any key, rear helmet lock has a lever installed to open and shut it completely. I have the parts to fix both locks.
*** I repeat, I have the locks for the bike to re-install these if you wish, I never got around to it but I have them ready to go. 

Serious inquiries only, test rides only with cash in hand.

Hello,
I am selling my 2008 Suzuki Vstrom with around 35,000 miles on it. Brand new brakes and rear tire. Tune up this year.

Love this bike but think I'm going to get a Harley. Would consider trade for a 1200cc bike or bigger and must be fuel injected. Firm on price.

Fantastic all-rounder bike has been beefed up for handling both asphalt and dirt roads/trails. Engine was removed and heads/valves, etc. redone by MotoItalia in late 2017 (400 miles ago) 
Continental TK80's with about 3/4 tread life and an extra set of road going Dunlop spares
The good:
- New timing belts ($250)
- Rebuilt heads ($2000)
- Hand Guards
- Recent synthetic oil change
- Recent D&D chain
- Carbon fibre Termignoni Exhaust
- Comes with bracket and Ducati soft bags
- Carbon fibre chin guard
- Carbon fibre Rear Hugger
- Strada Avventurosa front end rise kit with Acerbis dirt bike front fender $200
- Strada Avventurosa crash bars - $400
The Bad:
The bike was low sided up Poudre Canyon by my 75-year-old dad (bless his heart) and it received a bit of road rash but nothing mechanical/broken... just plastic. I decided to just leave that alone and invest in making it truly an off-road capable bike... it does just that! This bike is good for another 30K easy before any tune-up needed.

Very fun and capable on both asphalt and dirt. Would be a great touring bike or just bashing around the back roads. Hopefully you know what you are looking at and are not new to Ducati... these bikes are a dream ride and not terrible in the maint. department if you keep up on it.

*No Scams or help selling. Serious inquiries only please.

Runs perfect, rides great with nearly new tires (~200 mi. on rear).  New battery, cam belts and valves are in perfect shape. A few scratches on the tank and a very small one on the fairing from Storage. :(

The bike handles like a dream. LED tail rear stop light, and turn signals.  Also a few carbon fiber goodies...cam belt covers, half rear seat cover.  Weighted bar ends also has a remapped ECU, runs very smooth with some extra power.

Cash sales only face-to-face sales only I do not need any help selling. Text or calls work best, but I do check emails also.  I am looking for and Adventure bike and would entertain trades and additional cash for the right bike.

I have a 2005 Kawasaki ZX10r, it has upgraded ASV unbreakable levers I have MadMoto tear sets that aren't black and red that I haven't put on the bike just because I have been so busy. I took the stock air filter out and put in a aftermarket bmz air filter it has a 4 to 1 exhaust on it basically headers to pipe. It runs and sounds perfect no problems with the motor it currently has 26,500 miles on it. The triple tree top bearing is shot I have the all balls bearing kit for it top and bottom end but again just don't be have the time to work on it. It has been garage kept ever since the first owner he was a military guy who was being deported and I picked it up from him. I put just some small things on the bike like a new tank grip front and rear brake pads about 1000 miles ago. Tires both front and back are still in very good condition. Being that it's almost winter I'm sure it will just sit and I think someone would get way more out of it than me. Any questions or if you want any info. Don't be afraid to ask names Eric 719-threesix092zerosix. I have two stands front and rear for easy work as well. Clean title in hand. Must have cash in hand to test ride or appropriate collateral serious inquires only!!! Will trade for a pickup text me for more pictures I have tons!!

Selling my bike that needs to be ridden. Haven't ridden it in almost 2 years. Needs a battery, seat cover replaced ( seat got left outside during a hail storm while out of town) and front fender (pushed against the tire at a high speed so the tire rubbed through the center of it). Has been stretched 11" lowering links, dropped front, iridium windscreen, Lamborghini orancio borealis ppg paint. Paint job was $2000. Dunlop Q3 tires with less than 1000 miles on em. This bike gets attention everywhere it gets ridden. You won't be disappointed. Rode between Cheyenne to Denver enough to rack up 10,000 miles. Time for someone else to enjoy it.

Great bike, just don't ride much anymore. Tons of extras and mechanically perfect. Engine professionally rebuilt and bored over about 5k miles ago. Power commander V, shorty levers, new sprockets and chain, drag bar (way more comfortable to ride), hot bodies full exhaust, Dunlop Q3 tires with not a lot of miles on them, rear cowl included, rear stand included, blue lights on the underbelly, brakes are good, factory recalls are taken care of. If I kept it, I'd probably replace the fairings. They look good, they're just not perfect anymore. 

Cash in hand if you want to ride it. It's a seriously fast bike. Text is preferred during the day cause I'm at work. No trades please.

Recently purchased camper trailer so selling to make room in the garage for more toys. Just do not ride as much as I feel this beast needs.

Previous owner did lay down, but all damage is cosmetic. The bike is equipped with frame slides.

Will meet in Castle Rock for test ride for serious buyers only with endorsement and cash in hand. 50% held during test ride.

If post is still up it is still for sale.

Fantastic all-rounder bike has been beefed up for handling both asphalt and dirt roads/trails. Engine was removed and heads/valves, etc. redone by MotoItalia in late 2017 (400 miles ago) 
Continental TK80's with about 3/4 tread life and an extra set of road going Dunlop spares
The good:
- New timing belts ($250)
- Rebuilt heads ($2000)
- Hand Guards
- Recent synthetic oil change
- Recent D&D chain
- Carbon fibre Termignoni Exhaust
- Comes with bracket and Ducati soft bags
- Carbon fibre chin guard
- Carbon fibre Rear Hugger
- Strada Avventurosa front end rise kit with Acerbis dirt bike front fender $200
- Strada Avventurosa crash bars - $400
The Bad:
The bike was low sided up Poudre Canyon by my 75-year-old dad (bless his heart) and it received a bit of road rash but nothing mechanical/broken... just plastic. I decided to just leave that alone and invest in making it truly an off-road capable bike... it does just that! This bike is good for another 30K easy before any tune-up needed.

Very fun and capable on both asphalt and dirt. Would be a great touring bike or just bashing around the back roads. Hopefully you know what you are looking at and are not new to Ducati... these bikes are a dream ride and not terrible in the maint. department if you keep up on it.

*No Scams or help selling. Serious inquiries only please.

Selling my bike that needs to be ridden. Haven't ridden it in almost 2 years. Needs a battery, seat cover replaced ( seat got left outside during a hail storm while out of town) and front fender (pushed against the tire at a high speed so the tire rubbed through the center of it). Has been stretched 11" lowering links, dropped front, iridium windscreen, Lamborghini orancio borealis ppg paint. Paint job was $2000. Dunlop Q3 tires with less than 1000 miles on em. This bike gets attention everywhere it gets ridden. You won't be disappointed. Rode between Cheyenne to Denver enough to rack up 10,000 miles. Time for someone else to enjoy it.

Great bike, just don't ride much anymore. Tons of extras and mechanically perfect. Engine professionally rebuilt and bored over about 5k miles ago. Power commander V, shorty levers, new sprockets and chain, drag bar (way more comfortable to ride), hot bodies full exhaust, Dunlop Q3 tires with not a lot of miles on them, rear cowl included, rear stand included, blue lights on the underbelly, brakes are good, factory recalls are taken care of. If I kept it, I'd probably replace the fairings. They look good, they're just not perfect anymore. 

Cash in hand if you want to ride it. It's a seriously fast bike. Text is preferred during the day cause I'm at work. No trades please.

Hello,
I am selling my 2008 Suzuki Vstrom with around 35,000 miles on it. Brand new brakes and rear tire. Tune up this year.

Love this bike but think I'm going to get a Harley. Would consider trade for a 1200cc bike or bigger and must be fuel injected. Firm on price.

Fantastic all-rounder bike has been beefed up for handling both asphalt and dirt roads/trails. Engine was removed and heads/valves, etc. redone by MotoItalia in late 2017 (400 miles ago) 
Continental TK80's with about 3/4 tread life and an extra set of road going Dunlop spares
The good:
- New timing belts ($250)
- Rebuilt heads ($2000)
- Hand Guards
- Recent synthetic oil change
- Recent D&D chain
- Carbon fibre Termignoni Exhaust
- Comes with bracket and Ducati soft bags
- Carbon fibre chin guard
- Carbon fibre Rear Hugger
- Strada Avventurosa front end rise kit with Acerbis dirt bike front fender $200
- Strada Avventurosa crash bars - $400
The Bad:
The bike was low sided up Poudre Canyon by my 75-year-old dad (bless his heart) and it received a bit of road rash but nothing mechanical/broken... just plastic. I decided to just leave that alone and invest in making it truly an off-road capable bike... it does just that! This bike is good for another 30K easy before any tune-up needed.

Very fun and capable on both asphalt and dirt. Would be a great touring bike or just bashing around the back roads. Hopefully you know what you are looking at and are not new to Ducati... these bikes are a dream ride and not terrible in the maint. department if you keep up on it.

*No Scams or help selling. Serious inquiries only please.

2005 Yamaha R1.  New chain and sprockets, new battery, new rear tire, front tire at about 75%.  Valves were adjusted by Tri City Cycle less than 1,000 miles ago.  Has frame sliders.

This thing hauls, definitely not for the faint of heart.  Test drives only with cash in hand.  Can deliver for an extra $100.  Would consider trade plus cash for well running ski boat.

2003 Ducati Monster 1000 cc SIE (fuel injection.)

Runs perfect, rides great with nearly new tires (~200 mi. on rear).  New battery, cam belts and valves are in perfect shape. A few scratches on the tank and a very small one on the fairing from Storage. :(

The bike handles like a dream. LED tail rear stop light, and turn signals.  Also a few carbon fiber goodies...cam belt covers, half rear seat cover.  Weighted bar ends also has a remapped ECU, runs very smooth with some extra power.

Cash sales only face-to-face sales only I do not need any help selling. Text or calls work best, but I do check emails also.  I am looking for and Adventure bike and would entertain trades and additional cash for the right bike.

I have a 2005 Kawasaki ZX10r, it has upgraded ASV unbreakable levers I have MadMoto tear sets that aren't black and red that I haven't put on the bike just because I have been so busy. I took the stock air filter out and put in a aftermarket bmz air filter it has a 4 to 1 exhaust on it basically headers to pipe. It runs and sounds perfect no problems with the motor it currently has 26,500 miles on it. The triple tree top bearing is shot I have the all balls bearing kit for it top and bottom end but again just don't be have the time to work on it. It has been garage kept ever since the first owner he was a military guy who was being deported and I picked it up from him. I put just some small things on the bike like a new tank grip front and rear brake pads about 1000 miles ago. Tires both front and back are still in very good condition. Being that it's almost winter I'm sure it will just sit and I think someone would get way more out of it than me. Any questions or if you want any info. Don't be afraid to ask names Eric 719-threesix092zerosix. I have two stands front and rear for easy work as well. Clean title in hand. Must have cash in hand to test ride or appropriate collateral serious inquires only!!! Will trade for a pickup text me for more pictures I have tons!!

Selling my bike that needs to be ridden. Haven't ridden it in almost 2 years. Needs a battery, seat cover replaced ( seat got left outside during a hail storm while out of town) and front fender (pushed against the tire at a high speed so the tire rubbed through the center of it). Has been stretched 11" lowering links, dropped front, iridium windscreen, Lamborghini orancio borealis ppg paint. Paint job was $2000. Dunlop Q3 tires with less than 1000 miles on em. This bike gets attention everywhere it gets ridden. You won't be disappointed. Rode between Cheyenne to Denver enough to rack up 10,000 miles. Time for someone else to enjoy it.

Great bike, just don't ride much anymore. Tons of extras and mechanically perfect. Engine professionally rebuilt and bored over about 5k miles ago. Power commander V, shorty levers, new sprockets and chain, drag bar (way more comfortable to ride), hot bodies full exhaust, Dunlop Q3 tires with not a lot of miles on them, rear cowl included, rear stand included, blue lights on the underbelly, brakes are good, factory recalls are taken care of. If I kept it, I'd probably replace the fairings. They look good, they're just not perfect anymore. 

Cash in hand if you want to ride it. It's a seriously fast bike. Text is preferred during the day cause I'm at work. No trades please.

Runs great. I have owned for 5 years without any mechanical issues. Racing exhaust, tuning performance chip, shaved/integrated signals and mirrors. Red accent lighting 

Recently purchased camper trailer so selling to make room in the garage for more toys. Just do not ride as much as I feel this beast needs.

Previous owner did lay down, but all damage is cosmetic. The bike is equipped with frame slides.

Will meet in Castle Rock for test ride for serious buyers only with endorsement and cash in hand. 50% held during test ride.

If post is still up it is still for sale.

Highly customized, one of a kind Suzuki SV1000S for sale by owner! 

Less than 14,200 miles with clean title. Extremely fun bike for riding around the city in style or cruising the mountain canyons. Has a growl like none other and runs reliably and smoothly. Never been laid down, always garage kept, excellent condition. Fast...

Many upgrades including: Custom chameleon flake style paint, custom skull details on Suzuki logos, shortened exhausts, eliminator front and rear turn signals, brand new street tires, aftermarket levers, grips, bubble windscreen, and extended side mirrors. 

***Bike had to be re-keyed in the past so there is no tank or rear seat lock installed. Tank shuts completely and be can be opened by any key, rear helmet lock has a lever installed to open and shut it completely. I have the parts to fix both locks.
*** I repeat, I have the locks for the bike to re-install these if you wish, I never got around to it but I have them ready to go. 

Serious inquiries only, test rides only with cash in hand.

I am selling my 2008 Suzuki Vstrom with around 35,000 miles on it. Brand new brakes and rear tire. Tune up this year.

Love this bike but think I'm going to get a Harley. Would consider trade for a 1200cc bike or bigger and must be fuel injected. Firm on price.

Fantastic all-rounder bike has been beefed up for handling both asphalt and dirt roads/trails. Engine was removed and heads/valves, etc. redone by MotoItalia in late 2017 (400 miles ago) 
Continental TK80's with about 3/4 tread life and an extra set of road going Dunlop spares
The good:
- New timing belts ($250)
- Rebuilt heads ($2000)
- Hand Guards
- Recent synthetic oil change
- Recent D&D chain
- Carbon fibre Termignoni Exhaust
- Comes with bracket and Ducati soft bags
- Carbon fibre chin guard
- Carbon fibre Rear Hugger
- Strada Avventurosa front end rise kit with Acerbis dirt bike front fender $200
- Strada Avventurosa crash bars - $400
The Bad:
The bike was low sided up Poudre Canyon by my 75-year-old dad (bless his heart) and it received a bit of road rash but nothing mechanical/broken... just plastic. I decided to just leave that alone and invest in making it truly an off-road capable bike... it does just that! This bike is good for another 30K easy before any tune-up needed.

Very fun and capable on both asphalt and dirt. Would be a great touring bike or just bashing around the back roads. Hopefully you know what you are looking at and are not new to Ducati... these bikes are a dream ride and not terrible in the maint. department if you keep up on it.

*No Scams or help selling. Serious inquiries only please.

Selling my bike that needs to be ridden. Haven't ridden it in almost 2 years. Needs a battery, seat cover replaced ( seat got left outside during a hail storm while out of town) and front fender (pushed against the tire at a high speed so the tire rubbed through the center of it). Has been stretched 11" lowering links, dropped front, iridium windscreen, Lamborghini orancio borealis ppg paint. Paint job was $2000. Dunlop Q3 tires with less than 1000 miles on em. This bike gets attention everywhere it gets ridden. You won't be disappointed. Rode between Cheyenne to Denver enough to rack up 10,000 miles. Time for someone else to enjoy it.

Great bike, just don't ride much anymore. Tons of extras and mechanically perfect. Engine professionally rebuilt and bored over about 5k miles ago. Power commander V, shorty levers, new sprockets and chain, drag bar (way more comfortable to ride), hot bodies full exhaust, Dunlop Q3 tires with not a lot of miles on them, rear cowl included, rear stand included, blue lights on the underbelly, brakes are good, factory recalls are taken care of. If I kept it, I'd probably replace the fairings. They look good, they're just not perfect anymore. 

Cash in hand if you want to ride it. It's a seriously fast bike. Text is preferred during the day cause I'm at work. No trades please.

Highly customized, one of a kind Suzuki SV1000S for sale by owner! 

Less than 14,200 miles with clean title. Extremely fun bike for riding around the city in style or cruising the mountain canyons. Has a growl like none other and runs reliably and smoothly. Never been laid down, always garage kept, excellent condition. Fast...

Many upgrades including: Custom chameleon flake style paint, custom skull details on Suzuki logos, shortened exhausts, eliminator front and rear turn signals, brand new street tires, aftermarket levers, grips, bubble windscreen, and extended side mirrors. 

***Bike had to be re-keyed in the past so there is no tank or rear seat lock installed. Tank shuts completely and be can be opened by any key, rear helmet lock has a lever installed to open and shut it completely. I have the parts to fix both locks.
*** I repeat, I have the locks for the bike to re-install these if you wish, I never got around to it but I have them ready to go. 

Serious inquiries only, test rides only with cash in hand.

I have a 2005 Kawasaki ZX10r, it has upgraded ASV unbreakable levers I have MadMoto tear sets that aren't black and red that I haven't put on the bike just because I have been so busy. I took the stock air filter out and put in a aftermarket bmz air filter it has a 4 to 1 exhaust on it basically headers to pipe. It runs and sounds perfect no problems with the motor it currently has 26,500 miles on it. The triple tree top bearing is shot I have the all balls bearing kit for it top and bottom end but again just don't be have the time to work on it. It has been garage kept ever since the first owner he was a military guy who was being deported and I picked it up from him. I put just some small things on the bike like a new tank grip front and rear brake pads about 1000 miles ago. Tires both front and back are still in very good condition. Being that it's almost winter I'm sure it will just sit and I think someone would get way more out of it than me. Any questions or if you want any info. Don't be afraid to ask names Eric 719-threesix092zerosix. I have two stands front and rear for easy work as well. Clean title in hand. Must have cash in hand to test ride or appropriate collateral serious inquires only!!! Will trade for a pickup text me for more pictures I have tons!!

Not sure I really want to do this, but testing the waters to sell my 2003 Suzuki GSXR 1000

29297 miles. Never been down. Many modifications and very meticulously maintained.

Mods/Maintenances are:
Yoshimura RS-3 exhaust
Healtech GIPRO w/ATRE (Advanced Timing Retard Eliminator)
Healtech SpeedoHealer
Tinted Zero Gravity double bubble windscreen
APE manuel cam chain tensioner
Graves AIS block off plates
MZS shorty levers
New ProGrip 719 gel grips when I did the MZS levers
Integrated brake light/blinkers
Flush mount front blinkers
Stainless steel brake lines and SBS semi-metallic brake pads, drained and replaced all the brake fluid also.
Front forks rebuilt with 1.0 kg/mm Race Tech springs (stock is 0.85 kg/mm)
I had the chain and both sprockets replaced with new OEM at 20500
I had a valve shim adjustment done at roughly 24000 miles
It had Bridestone Battlax BT023 front and rear tires installed at roughly 24000
Completely flushed out the cooling system and replaced with new 50/50 coolant at roughly 24000
I installed a new battery in April 2016
The factory ignition anti-theft resistor began to fail intermittently so I replaced it with a brand new ignition, fuel tank door, and lock set in April 2016.
I did a custom one-off graphics set, and painted some select bolt heads in June of 2017. Really sets the bike apart and makes it pop. 

I'm sure there is more that I'm forgetting at this time. I've owned the bike since 2008 and I love it, but hard times call for drastic measures.

Been asking $4,000 or best offer, but I want to see it go to a good home, so I'll entertain all cash offers. Shoot me an offer, worst I can say is "no thank you". 

Also I have a Joe Rocket helmet and gloves I can throw in as well.

No test rides without cash in hand.

I do not need help selling.
Thanks for looking

Selling my bike that needs to be ridden. Haven't ridden it in almost 2 years. Needs a battery, seat cover replaced ( seat got left outside during a hail storm while out of town) and front fender (pushed against the tire at a high speed so the tire rubbed through the center of it). Has been stretched 11" lowering links, dropped front, iridium windscreen, Lamborghini orancio borealis ppg paint. Paint job was $2000. Dunlop Q3 tires with less than 1000 miles on em. This bike gets attention everywhere it gets ridden. You won't be disappointed. Rode between Cheyenne to Denver enough to rack up 10,000 miles. Time for someone else to enjoy it.

Great bike, just don't ride much anymore. Tons of extras and mechanically perfect. Engine professionally rebuilt and bored over about 5k miles ago. Power commander V, shorty levers, new sprockets and chain, drag bar (way more comfortable to ride), hot bodies full exhaust, Dunlop Q3 tires with not a lot of miles on them, rear cowl included, rear stand included, blue lights on the underbelly, brakes are good, factory recalls are taken care of. If I kept it, I'd probably replace the fairings. They look good, they're just not perfect anymore. 

Cash in hand if you want to ride it. It's a seriously fast bike. Text is preferred during the day cause I'm at work. No trades please.

Highly customized, one of a kind Suzuki SV1000S for sale by owner! 

Less than 14,200 miles with clean title. Extremely fun bike for riding around the city in style or cruising the mountain canyons. Has a growl like none other and runs reliably and smoothly. Never been laid down, always garage kept, excellent condition. Fast...

Many upgrades including: Custom chameleon flake style paint, custom skull details on Suzuki logos, shortened exhausts, eliminator front and rear turn signals, brand new street tires, aftermarket levers, grips, bubble windscreen, and extended side mirrors. 

***Bike had to be re-keyed in the past so there is no tank or rear seat lock installed. Tank shuts completely and be can be opened by any key, rear helmet lock has a lever installed to open and shut it completely. I have the parts to fix both locks.
*** I repeat, I have the locks for the bike to re-install these if you wish, I never got around to it but I have them ready to go. 

Serious inquiries only, test rides only with cash in hand.

I have a 2005 Kawasaki ZX10r, it has upgraded ASV unbreakable levers I have MadMoto tear sets that aren't black and red that I haven't put on the bike just because I have been so busy. I took the stock air filter out and put in a aftermarket bmz air filter it has a 4 to 1 exhaust on it basically headers to pipe. It runs and sounds perfect no problems with the motor it currently has 26,500 miles on it. The triple tree top bearing is shot I have the all balls bearing kit for it top and bottom end but again just don't be have the time to work on it. It has been garage kept ever since the first owner he was a military guy who was being deported and I picked it up from him. I put just some small things on the bike like a new tank grip front and rear brake pads about 1000 miles ago. Tires both front and back are still in very good condition. Being that it's almost winter I'm sure it will just sit and I think someone would get way more out of it than me. Any questions or if you want any info. Don't be afraid to ask names Eric 719-threesix092zerosix. I have two stands front and rear for easy work as well. Clean title in hand.

Fantastic all-rounder bike has been beefed up for handling both asphalt and dirt roads/trails. Engine was removed and heads/valves, etc. redone by MotoItalia in late 2017 (400 miles ago) 
Continental TK80's with about 3/4 tread life and an extra set of road going Dunlop spares
The good:
- New timing belts ($250)
- Rebuilt heads ($2000)
- Hand Guards
- Recent synthetic oil change
- Recent D&D chain
- Carbon fibre Termignoni Exhaust
- Comes with bracket and Ducati soft bags
- Carbon fibre chin guard
- Carbon fibre Rear Hugger
- Strada Avventurosa front end rise kit with Acerbis dirt bike front fender $200
- Strada Avventurosa crash bars - $400
The Bad:
The bike was low sided up Poudre Canyon by my 75-year-old dad (bless his heart) and it received a bit of road rash but nothing mechanical/broken... just plastic. I decided to just leave that alone and invest in making it truly an off-road capable bike... it does just that! This bike is good for another 30K easy before any tune-up needed.

Very fun and capable on both asphalt and dirt. Would be a great touring bike or just bashing around the back roads. Hopefully you know what you are looking at and are not new to Ducati... these bikes are a dream ride and not terrible in the maint. department if you keep up on it.

*No Scams or help selling. Serious inquiries only please.

Runs perfect, rides great with nearly new tires (~200 mi. on rear).  New battery, cam belts and valves are in perfect shape. A few scratches on the tank and a very small one on the fairing from Storage. :(

The bike handles like a dream. LED tail rear stop light, and turn signals.  Also a few carbon fiber goodies...cam belt covers, half rear seat cover.  Weighted bar ends also has a remapped ECU, runs very smooth with some extra power.

Cash sales only face-to-face sales only I do not need any help selling. Text or calls work best, but I do check emails also.  I am looking for and Adventure bike and would entertain trades and additional cash for the right bike.

Selling my bike that needs to be ridden. Haven't ridden it in almost 2 years. Needs a battery, seat cover replaced ( seat got left outside during a hail storm while out of town) and front fender (pushed against the tire at a high speed so the tire rubbed through the center of it). Has been stretched 11" lowering links, dropped front, iridium windscreen, Lamborghini orancio borealis ppg paint. Paint job was $2000. Dunlop Q3 tires with less than 1000 miles on em. This bike gets attention everywhere it gets ridden. You won't be disappointed. Rode between Cheyenne to Denver enough to rack up 10,000 miles. Time for someone else to enjoy it.

-Upgraded seat
-Saddlebags 
-Cover
-Good tires for another season of riding 

I have maintained the bike properly and had the bike in for maintenance/check up in January, no issues. Haven't ridden it much other than to keep the bike active one time a week. 

I am serious about the price and you should be too. It's a clean title. Cash in hand before a test ride.

I've got more photos and video I can send.

Great bike, just don't ride much anymore. Tons of extras and mechanically perfect. Engine professionally rebuilt and bored over about 5k miles ago. Power commander V, shorty levers, new sprockets and chain, drag bar (way more comfortable to ride), hot bodies full exhaust, Dunlop Q3 tires with not a lot of miles on them, rear cowl included, rear stand included, blue lights on the underbelly, brakes are good, factory recalls are taken care of. If I kept it, I'd probably replace the fairings. They look good, they're just not perfect anymore. 

Cash in hand if you want to ride it. It's a seriously fast bike. Text is preferred during the day cause I'm at work. No trades please.

Highly customized, one of a kind Suzuki SV1000S for sale by owner! 

Less than 14,200 miles with clean title. Extremely fun bike for riding around the city in style or cruising the mountain canyons. Has a growl like none other and runs reliably and smoothly. Never been laid down, always garage kept, excellent condition. Fast...

Many upgrades including: Custom chameleon flake style paint, custom skull details on Suzuki logos, shortened exhausts, eliminator front and rear turn signals, brand new street tires, aftermarket levers, grips, bubble windscreen, and extended side mirrors. 

***Bike had to be re-keyed in the past so there is no tank or rear seat lock installed. Tank shuts completely and be can be opened by any key, rear helmet lock has a lever installed to open and shut it completely. I have the parts to fix both locks.
*** I repeat, I have the locks for the bike to re-install these if you wish, I never got around to it but I have them ready to go.

Fantastic all-rounder bike has been beefed up for handling both asphalt and dirt roads/trails. Engine was removed and heads/valves, etc. redone by MotoItalia in late 2017 (400 miles ago) 
Continental TK80's with about 3/4 tread life and an extra set of road going Dunlop spares
The good:
- New timing belts ($250)
- Rebuilt heads ($2000)
- Hand Guards
- Recent synthetic oil change
- Recent D&D chain
- Carbon fibre Termignoni Exhaust
- Comes with bracket and Ducati soft bags
- Carbon fibre chin guard
- Carbon fibre Rear Hugger
- Strada Avventurosa front end rise kit with Acerbis dirt bike front fender $200
- Strada Avventurosa crash bars - $400
The Bad:
The bike was low sided up Poudre Canyon by my 75-year-old dad (bless his heart) and it received a bit of road rash but nothing mechanical/broken... just plastic. I decided to just leave that alone and invest in making it truly an off-road capable bike... it does just that! This bike is good for another 30K easy before any tune-up needed.

Very fun and capable on both asphalt and dirt. Would be a great touring bike or just bashing around the back roads. Hopefully you know what you are looking at and are not new to Ducati... these bikes are a dream ride and not terrible in the maint. department if you keep up on it.

*No Scams or help selling. Serious inquiries only please.

Not sure I really want to do this, but testing the waters to sell my 2003 Suzuki GSXR 1000

29297 miles. Never been down. Many modifications and very meticulously maintained.

Mods/Maintenances are:
Yoshimura RS-3 exhaust
Healtech GIPRO w/ATRE (Advanced Timing Retard Eliminator)
Healtech SpeedoHealer
Tinted Zero Gravity double bubble windscreen
APE manuel cam chain tensioner
Graves AIS block off plates
MZS shorty levers
New ProGrip 719 gel grips when I did the MZS levers
Integrated brake light/blinkers
Flush mount front blinkers
Stainless steel brake lines and SBS semi-metallic brake pads, drained and replaced all the brake fluid also.
Front forks rebuilt with 1.0 kg/mm Race Tech springs (stock is 0.85 kg/mm)
I had the chain and both sprockets replaced with new OEM at 20500
I had a valve shim adjustment done at roughly 24000 miles
It had Bridestone Battlax BT023 front and rear tires installed at roughly 24000
Completely flushed out the cooling system and replaced with new 50/50 coolant at roughly 24000
I installed a new battery in April 2016
The factory ignition anti-theft resistor began to fail intermittently so I replaced it with a brand new ignition, fuel tank door, and lock set in April 2016.
I did a custom one-off graphics set, and painted some select bolt heads in June of 2017. Really sets the bike apart and makes it pop. 

I'm sure there is more that I'm forgetting at this time. I've owned the bike since 2008 and I love it, but hard times call for drastic measures.

Been asking $4,000 or best offer, but I want to see it go to a good home, so I'll entertain all cash offers. Shoot me an offer, worst I can say is "no thank you". 

Also I have a Joe Rocket helmet and gloves I can throw in as well.

No test rides without cash in hand.

I do not need help selling.
Thanks for looking

Selling my bike that needs to be ridden. Haven't ridden it in almost 2 years. Needs a battery, seat cover replaced ( seat got left outside during a hail storm while out of town) and front fender (pushed against the tire at a high speed so the tire rubbed through the center of it). Has been stretched 11" lowering links, dropped front, iridium windscreen, Lamborghini orancio borealis ppg paint. Paint job was $2000. Dunlop Q3 tires with less than 1000 miles on em. This bike gets attention everywhere it gets ridden. You won't be disappointed. Rode between Cheyenne to Denver enough to rack up 10,000 miles. Time for someone else to enjoy it.

Great bike, just don't ride much anymore. Tons of extras and mechanically perfect. Engine professionally rebuilt and bored over about 5k miles ago. Power commander V, shorty levers, new sprockets and chain, drag bar (way more comfortable to ride), hot bodies full exhaust, Dunlop Q3 tires with not a lot of miles on them, rear cowl included, rear stand included, blue lights on the underbelly, brakes are good, factory recalls are taken care of. If I kept it, I'd probably replace the fairings. They look good, they're just not perfect anymore. 

Cash in hand if you want to ride it. It's a seriously fast bike. Text is preferred during the day cause I'm at work. No trades please.

Highly customized, one of a kind Suzuki SV1000S for sale by owner! 

Less than 14,200 miles with clean title. Extremely fun bike for riding around the city in style or cruising the mountain canyons. Has a growl like none other and runs reliably and smoothly. Never been laid down, always garage kept, excellent condition. Fast...

Many upgrades including: Custom chameleon flake style paint, custom skull details on Suzuki logos, shortened exhausts, eliminator front and rear turn signals, brand new street tires, aftermarket levers, grips, bubble windscreen, and extended side mirrors. 

***Bike had to be re-keyed in the past so there is no tank or rear seat lock installed. Tank shuts completely and be can be opened by any key, rear helmet lock has a lever installed to open and shut it completely. I have the parts to fix both locks.
*** I repeat, I have the locks for the bike to re-install these if you wish, I never got around to it but I have them ready to go.

I have a 2005 Kawasaki ZX10r, it has upgraded ASV unbreakable levers I have MadMoto tear sets that aren't black and red that I haven't put on the bike just because I have been so busy. I took the stock air filter out and put in a aftermarket bmz air filter it has a 4 to 1 exhaust on it basically headers to pipe. It runs and sounds perfect no problems with the motor it currently has 26,500 miles on it. The triple tree top bearing is shot I have the all balls bearing kit for it top and bottom end but again just don't be have the time to work on it. It has been garage kept ever since the first owner he was a military guy who was being deported and I picked it up from him. I put just some small things on the bike like a new tank grip front and rear brake pads about 1000 miles ago. Tires both front and back are still in very good condition. Being that it's almost winter I'm sure it will just sit and I think someone would get way more out of it than me. Any questions or if you want any info. Don't be afraid to ask names Eric 719-threesix092zerosix. I have two stands front and rear for easy work as well. Clean title in hand. Must have cash in hand to test ride or appropriate collateral serious inquires only!!! Will trade for a pickup text me for more pictures I have tons!!

Hello,
 Posting my 2003 FZ1 up for sale. Got the bike about 2 years ago and it's time to switch to a cruiser. This naked bike is basically an R1 for the real world, comfortable but still incredibly fast and nimble.

Great condition and low milage (14,200). It's a carbureted bike so takes a minute to warm up if the weather is under 60. Other than that, runs like a champ. This earlier version has better acceleration than the newer fuel injected ones.

Inspection, oil change and brand new tires at the beginning of the season.
Indoor winter storage and covered in the summer.
Very comfortable with bar riser for taller people.

Looks like the previous owner had a 0 speed parking lot drop. Some horizontal scrapes on the bar end. No dents and all alignments checked by my mechanic. I commute on 95 a few days a week and there's not even a hint of a shake.

Hi, I'm reposting this bike due to a sale that did not fall through. The bike is very nice. I rode it for 2.5 seasons without any issues whatsoever, I only turned a wrench on the bike when I wanted to. The bike has too much done to list, but I'll try. Driven performance race clutch kit, shorty adjustable levers, moto gp exhaust (bike is insainly loud, I also have a yoshi muffler to go with the purchase), increased flow air filter, many many cosmetics, ect. The bike has 37k on it, valves were done 2k ago, I believe I have the paperwork. Mechanic said the motor looked incredible with no signs of wear (I believe that's in the write up for the valves). The only bad thing about the bike is it could probably use an oil change (I can do it before the purchase for a few extra bucks). And there probably about 1 more season left on the tires under normal riding conditions. This will be my last time trying to sell this bike for this price, if it doesn't sell I'll keep it for the winter and just sell it for more come spring. Any questions feel free to call/text  show contact info
, it is rare that I check/ respond to emails. Thanks!

Rare Exotic High Performance Beauty!  Ride something different! Only a handful in the country!  2003 Aprilia Caponord ETV1000 Adventure.  100HP Rotax V-twin.  Timeless design still looks fresh and exotic. Bike is FAST.  Easily keep pace with 1000cc crotch rockets, then take dirt roads home!  This bike is know to be very reliable after a few issues are sorted.  Many examples over 100k miles.  Guess what.... I've sorted all the issues.  New Honda CBR1000 Mosfet rectifier installed for good battery charging. Plastic fuel fittings that leak replaced with stainless steel.  New coils.  Fuel injection vacuum lines replaced.  This bike is rock solid reliable.  I wouldn't hesitate to head across the country on it!  Recently did the Vermont Puppy Dog Route and the Trans Mass Trail on it. No high maintenance Italian girlfriend here! Looks awesome!  Runs awesome! Parts still easily available. Total setup for full adventure riding:  Givi locking trunk, soft side bags, tank cover and tank bag.  Bags come off in moments and you have a sports bike. Updated mirrors and LED rear turn signals. Selling because I am a man-child who can't control adrenaline craving and shouldn't own something this sporty for road rides.  Consider trades toward BMW or KTM adventure bike.

Beautiful low mileage.  Original owner.  Runs perfectly. Always garaged.  Includes steering damper pictured.  Never crashed or raced. There's a dent in the left side of the tank from falling over against a curb.  The dent is covered by the Arai sticker in the photo.   I removed all the badges and stickers when I got it. 

Tires are Michelin Pilots and are in great shape. 

Also including a Leo Vince stainless exhaust.  Pictured.  

It is equipped with Heli bars that raise the grips about 2" from stock.  The stock bars are included.  Pictured. 

Cash only.  No test rides.

Bike currently has 5,9XX miles on it. Everything works as it should, tires are in decent shape. 

I am the second owner of the bike and have changed the oil and filter every spring no matter how little I have driven it and 2 seasons ago changed all fluids.

The bike has never been down and really fun to ride. Only aftermarket parts are Odin bar end mirrors and Yoshimura exhaust.

The bike is border line flawless.
Will entertain some trades, would take a lake boat, the right Miata ot something with an LS motor.

Everything on this jeep has been done in the last 2000 miles. You can drive this on the road or go wherever you would like to offroad. The frame is in great shape but it was boxed in the rear long before I got the jeep. You will NOT see another jeep like this anywhere. It runs fantastic and sounds even better. I do not have the time to appreciate what this jeep can do anymore. Inspected last month as well. Nothing on this jeep hasn't been touched from fluids to paint. The only thing with this jeep is there is not a ton of room in it. I am 5ft 8 and its not roomy for me. CJ5's did not have much for interior space and leg room. The seats were moved back some by notching the rear tire well a few inches. I just want to list everything I can think of. Also I run a torque pro app and an OBDII Bluetooth adapter for my dash. The Samsung tablet and adapter will come with the jeep. More than 20k invested but we all know how that works.

2005 Ducati 999 Superbike BLACK Dyno All Receipts

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Ducati 999 Biposto Testastretta Superbike BLACK Dyno All Receipts.

Title from Florida signed over to me on October 7, 2017. I never registered the Ducati in Connecticut. Rode only 30-miles and kept in my garage with my 1988 Ducati 750 Paso. Chain of Ownership will be documented by transfer of Ownership on the Florida Title that has been signed over to me, and also, a Connecticut Bill of Sale showing exchange of Ownership. Have sold a few Collectible Motorcycles over the years and the Chain-of Ownership documentation is all that is needed to transfer Title.

There are no Leaks, No Smoke, No Excuses, Nothing needed. Out of all the Motorcycles I have owned over the past 40-years, this is the most powerful, lightweight, beautiful, and best designed, as only Italy could have provided. Have owned a 1979 Honda CBX (6-cylinder), a 1978 Benelli 750 SEI (6-cylinder), and 15 others- this Ducati 999 is the BEST, Hands down.

Weighs 402-pounds, Produces 127.64 hp at the rear wheel; 72.51 ft. lbs torque (See DynoJet Performance Output Sheet). Performance is capable of producing more smiles than a face can register. Really.

Have ALL receipts and Service Records, Including the original "Pre-Delivery Checklist".

Also, I do have the Owner's Manual and Red Key. In early 2000 models (up until recently in 2007/08), Ducati motorcycles came with keys that have a specialized anti-theft device. Similar to RFID (key-fobs, electronic strikes), these keys send a unique signal (each key blank will have it's own unique signal) to the motorcycle's computer which are required for operation of the bike using the stock ECU.  Black keys are used to start the bike. When the bike turns on it will read the signal from the black key and a valid signal is required before the bike will start. Red keys are primarily used to program the ECU to accept new signals. It's false that a red key is required for any service on your bike (unless that service is specifically programming new keys into the stock ECU). 

$ 6,000 spent on Service and Upgrades." $ 4,921. spent on 6,000- mile service. Always used Synthetic Oil. Installed Ducati Dynojet Power Commander PC ($ 360), Leo-Vance Cat Eliminator ( $180.), and Leo-Vance Slip-On-Kit ( $ 2,039).

My sacrifice is your win to own an awesome bike !  I'm selling my 2007 CBR 1000RR motorcycle. This bike is all muscle and not to be under estimated. This bike has new tires with 500 miles on them, new battery and totally pampered throughout. 12,000 miles currently but am still riding this season until the first snow flake. I also am selling my 2003 Suzuki Volusia 800 in excellent condition with 23,000 miles. Oil has been changed every 3,000 miles regularly. New battery was installed this Summer. Both bikes are road ready and need absolutely nothing to ride. I am firm on $5,000.00 for my CBR 1000RR. If you were to be interested in both bikes as one purchase my price is $7,500.00. The Suzuki is NOT available for sale by itself only.

Hi, I'm reposting this bike due to a sale that did not fall through. The bike is very nice. I rode it for 2.5 seasons without any issues whatsoever, I only turned a wrench on the bike when I wanted to. The bike has too much done to list, but I'll try. Driven performance race clutch kit, shorty adjustable levers, moto gp exhaust (bike is insainly loud, I also have a yoshi muffler to go with the purchase), increased flow air filter, many many cosmetics, ect. The bike has 37k on it, valves were done 2k ago, I believe I have the paperwork. Mechanic said the motor looked incredible with no signs of wear (I believe that's in the write up for the valves). The only bad thing about the bike is it could probably use an oil change (I can do it before the purchase for a few extra bucks). And there probably about 1 more season left on the tires under normal riding conditions. This will be my last time trying to sell this bike for this price, if it doesn't sell I'll keep it for the winter and just sell it for more come spring. Any questions feel free to call/text  show contact info
, it is rare that I check/ respond to emails. Thanks!

Rare Exotic High Performance Beauty!  Ride something different! Only a handful in the country!  2003 Aprilia Caponord ETV1000 Adventure.  100HP Rotax V-twin.  Timeless design still looks fresh and exotic. Bike is FAST.  Easily keep pace with 1000cc crotch rockets, then take dirt roads home!  This bike is know to be very reliable after a few issues are sorted.  Many examples over 100k miles.  Guess what.... I've sorted all the issues.  New Honda CBR1000 Mosfet rectifier installed for good battery charging. Plastic fuel fittings that leak replaced with stainless steel.  New coils.  Fuel injection vacuum lines replaced.  This bike is rock solid reliable.  I wouldn't hesitate to head across the country on it!  Recently did the Vermont Puppy Dog Route and the Trans Mass Trail on it. No high maintenance Italian girlfriend here! Looks awesome!  Runs awesome! Parts still easily available. Total setup for full adventure riding:  Givi locking trunk, soft side bags, tank cover and tank bag.  Bags come off in moments and you have a sports bike. Updated mirrors and LED rear turn signals. Selling because I am a man-child who can't control adrenaline craving and shouldn't own something this sporty for road rides.  Consider trades toward BMW or KTM adventure bike.

Bike currently has 5,9XX miles on it. Everything works as it should, tires are in decent shape. 

I am the second owner of the bike and have changed the oil and filter every spring no matter how little I have driven it and 2 seasons ago changed all fluids.

The bike has never been down and really fun to ride. Only aftermarket parts are Odin bar end mirrors and Yoshimura exhaust.

The bike is border line flawless.
Will entertain some trades, would take a lake boat, the right Miata ot something with an LS motor.

★★ '05 YAMAHA R1 RAVEN <10K MILES ★★

$3500

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Yamaha YZF-R1 with 9870 miles in great running condition. Bike was laid over on its left side but the left frame slider took the brunt of the fall. It was assessed by Moroney's Cycle of New Windsor, NY and was reported to be left with only cosmetic damage. The damage cost was quoted to be more than the book value of the bike so even though the title is still clean, I will be selling it with the damage disclosure statement checked off on the back of the title, which will render it "rebuilt" once it is registered in the buyer's name. I can provide a copy of the damage estimate to those seriously interested. The bike will pass inspection and ride perfectly. As it sits, it would make the perfect track bike but with new fairings and a tank, it could be a great road bike again too. It could also use a new shifter and left mirror. The engine casing is slightly filed down as well as the swingarm but nothing serious, no cracks. The bike comes with a Scorpion exhaust and a rear tire with low miles on it, as well as a brand new front tire (both Michelin Pilot Power II). Oil changed every 2,000 miles with Mobil 1 full synthetic, ran only 93 octane. Also an anodized gas cap was fitted on the bike so it comes with the OEM cap too. The bike does not come with the stands. 

Very quick machine, technically the lightest of all the R1 generations and very noticeable. Potentially an awesome deal for the right person. 

If serious about the bike, please look at the photos carefully and ask me any questions you might have. NO TRADES will be entertained, CASH ONLY. Thank you!

A great deal of thought, and MONEY was invested in this bike: It is an absolute JOY to ride, and with the plush seat, can go for many miles at a time. Needs nothing but a new rider. $4,000.

This is a 2004 Suzuki V Strom DL1000. Its in really nice shape, as you can see in the photos. The engine runs and sounds great. The battery was recently replaced, the fuel injectors were cleaned, and the throttle body was sync'd. The bike has an accessory wire/plug for a heated jacket, and a 12V charger port for your cell or GPS. A few things worth mentioning are: some of the minor/accessory plastics have cracks: the left hand grip guard (see photo), both plastic nuts around the base of the mirrors (they function just fine). I think this is pretty common among V-Stroms. They were there when I got it. Also, the tank has a very small linear dent (also pictured). Bike does not come with the center stand. 

I would consider trades for a civic/corolla or other cars.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking.

I have decided to sell my 2004 Ducati Monster 1000s.  I bought it as an "upgrade" over my 1997 Monster 750 but after 2 summers of riding both, I still prefer my older Duc so it's time to let the newer bike go.  The bike is in nearly pristine condition and runs strong.  It is a very quick bike with fuel injection.  It shares the styling of the original Monsters but without the headache of carbs and that makes it pretty unique in the Monster family.  The bike only has 2689 miles and has received all regular scheduled maintenance.  No scratches on the tank, or tears in the seat.  It has aftermarket Renthal bars but I also have the original stock bars if you want them.  The only thing the bike needs is new front rotors.  The front brakes pulse when stopping: not enough to impair driveability but I find it annoying and would replace the rotors if I were keeping the bike.  Pictures show current condition.

The bike can be inspected at my house on weekends.  It is tagged and insured and can be test driven by serious buyers with appropriate gear.  If you are interested, please reply by email through Craigslist and put "Ducati" in the subject line.

Thanks for looking.

Everything on this jeep has been done in the last 2000 miles. You can drive this on the road or go wherever you would like to offroad. The frame is in great shape but it was boxed in the rear long before I got the jeep. You will NOT see another jeep like this anywhere. It runs fantastic and sounds even better. I do not have the time to appreciate what this jeep can do anymore. Inspected last month as well. Nothing on this jeep hasn't been touched from fluids to paint. The only thing with this jeep is there is not a ton of room in it. I am 5ft 8 and its not roomy for me. CJ5's did not have much for interior space and leg room. The seats were moved back some by notching the rear tire well a few inches. I just want to list everything I can think of. Also I run a torque pro app and an OBDII Bluetooth adapter for my dash. The Samsung tablet and adapter will come with the jeep. More than 20k invested but we all know how that works. 
$16,000 obo No trades at this time.

My sacrifice is your win to own an awesome bike !  I'm selling my 2007 CBR 1000RR motorcycle. This bike is all muscle and not to be under estimated. This bike has new tires with 500 miles on them, new battery and totally pampered throughout. 12,000 miles currently but am still riding this season until the first snow flake. I also am selling my 2003 Suzuki Volusia 800 in excellent condition with 23,000 miles. Oil has been changed every 3,000 miles regularly. New battery was installed this Summer. Both bikes are road ready and need absolutely nothing to ride. I am firm on $5,000.00 for my CBR 1000RR. If you were to be interested in both bikes as one purchase my price is $7,500.00. The Suzuki is NOT available for sale by itself only.

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Ducati 999 Biposto Testastretta Superbike BLACK Dyno All Receipts.

Title from Florida signed over to me on October 7, 2017. I never registered the Ducati in Connecticut. Rode only 30-miles and kept in my garage with my 1988 Ducati 750 Paso. Chain of Ownership will be documented by transfer of Ownership on the Florida Title that has been signed over to me, and also, a Connecticut Bill of Sale showing exchange of Ownership. Have sold a few Collectible Motorcycles over the years and the Chain-of Ownership documentation is all that is needed to transfer Title.

There are no Leaks, No Smoke, No Excuses, Nothing needed. Out of all the Motorcycles I have owned over the past 40-years, this is the most powerful, lightweight, beautiful, and best designed, as only Italy could have provided. Have owned a 1979 Honda CBX (6-cylinder), a 1978 Benelli 750 SEI (6-cylinder), and 15 others- this Ducati 999 is the BEST, Hands down.

Weighs 402-pounds, Produces 127.64 hp at the rear wheel; 72.51 ft. lbs torque (See DynoJet Performance Output Sheet). Performance is capable of producing more smiles than a face can register. Really.

Have ALL receipts and Service Records, Including the original "Pre-Delivery Checklist".

Also, I do have the Owner's Manual and Red Key. In early 2000 models (up until recently in 2007/08), Ducati motorcycles came with keys that have a specialized anti-theft device. Similar to RFID (key-fobs, electronic strikes), these keys send a unique signal (each key blank will have it's own unique signal) to the motorcycle's computer which are required for operation of the bike using the stock ECU.  Black keys are used to start the bike. When the bike turns on it will read the signal from the black key and a valid signal is required before the bike will start. Red keys are primarily used to program the ECU to accept new signals. It's false that a red key is required for any service on your bike (unless that service is specifically programming new keys into the stock ECU). 

$ 6,000 spent on Service and Upgrades." $ 4,921. spent on 6,000- mile service. Always used Synthetic Oil. Installed Ducati Dynojet Power Commander PC ($ 360), Leo-Vance Cat Eliminator ( $180.), and Leo-Vance Slip-On-Kit ( $ 2,039).

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Yamaha YZF-R1 with 9870 miles in great running condition. Bike was laid over on its left side but the left frame slider took the brunt of the fall. It was assessed by Moroney's Cycle of New Windsor, NY and was reported to be left with only cosmetic damage. The damage cost was quoted to be more than the book value of the bike so even though the title is still clean, I will be selling it with the damage disclosure statement checked off on the back of the title, which will render it "rebuilt" once it is registered in the buyer's name. I can provide a copy of the damage estimate to those seriously interested. The bike will pass inspection and ride perfectly. As it sits, it would make the perfect track bike but with new fairings and a tank, it could be a great road bike again too. It could also use a new shifter and left mirror. The engine casing is slightly filed down as well as the swingarm but nothing serious, no cracks. The bike comes with a Scorpion exhaust and a rear tire with low miles on it, as well as a brand new front tire (both Michelin Pilot Power II). Oil changed every 2,000 miles with Mobil 1 full synthetic, ran only 93 octane. Also an anodized gas cap was fitted on the bike so it comes with the OEM cap too. The bike does not come with the stands. 

Very quick machine, technically the lightest of all the R1 generations and very noticeable. Potentially an awesome deal for the right person. 

If serious about the bike, please look at the photos carefully and ask me any questions you might have. NO TRADES will be entertained, CASH ONLY. Thank you!

This is a 2004 Suzuki V Strom DL1000. Its in really nice shape, as you can see in the photos. The engine runs and sounds great. The battery was recently replaced, the fuel injectors were cleaned, and the throttle body was sync'd. The bike has an accessory wire/plug for a heated jacket, and a 12V charger port for your cell or GPS. A few things worth mentioning are: some of the minor/accessory plastics have cracks: the left hand grip guard (see photo), both plastic nuts around the base of the mirrors (they function just fine). I think this is pretty common among V-Stroms. They were there when I got it. Also, the tank has a very small linear dent (also pictured). Bike does not come with the center stand. 

I would consider trades for a civic/corolla or other cars.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking.

I have decided to sell my 2004 Ducati Monster 1000s.  I bought it as an "upgrade" over my 1997 Monster 750 but after 2 summers of riding both, I still prefer my older Duc so it's time to let the newer bike go.  The bike is in nearly pristine condition and runs strong.  It is a very quick bike with fuel injection.  It shares the styling of the original Monsters but without the headache of carbs and that makes it pretty unique in the Monster family.  The bike only has 2689 miles and has received all regular scheduled maintenance.  No scratches on the tank, or tears in the seat.  It has aftermarket Renthal bars but I also have the original stock bars if you want them.  The only thing the bike needs is new front rotors.  The front brakes pulse when stopping: not enough to impair driveability but I find it annoying and would replace the rotors if I were keeping the bike.  Pictures show current condition.

The bike can be inspected at my house on weekends.  It is tagged and insured and can be test driven by serious buyers with appropriate gear.  If you are interested, please reply by email through Craigslist and put "Ducati" in the subject line.

Thanks for looking.

This is a private sale ad and I will ignore scam calls or emails, so save your and my time.
Make: APRILIAModel: TUONO 1000RYear: 2007Mileage: 24,300 Miles and going up as I ride it for fun. 
ABOUT THE MACHINE:A great italian naked motorcycle with matt black paint . With a V-Twin 1000cc engine generating more than 134 HP and racing suspension, this motorcycle is a dream to ride. It's light weight and fast! Styling is elegant and has a strong presence. It's not the "in your face" aggressive styling that most superbikes have today. NOT FOR BEGINNERS!
CONDITION:This machine operates as new: the VTwin motor is powerful - lots of Vtwin grunt and raw torque down low, building to a smoothhigh-end power peak. The brakes and suspension are racing quality. No leaks or any issues of any kind. Modern hydraulic clutch and eletronic anti-theft mechanism. Included original manual + (2) original keys. Bike is in excellent shape and works fine. No cracks or broken tabs. Has a few scratches on radiator but nothing broken. Mechanically it works great.
Summary of mods and upgrades done to the bike, included in price:- Upgraded signals- Fender Eliminator- Extra Loud Hella Horn- Pro Taper Mini Low Handlebar - original handlebar included- Compu-Fire Regulator for 40A 3-Phase Charging Systems 55402
Add-ons NOT included in original price but available for sale with the Bike:- Mivv Motor GP Black Exhaust ($350)- MFW Vario Footpeg System, adjustable peg system for comfort ($160)- Woodcraft Folding Extended Toe Piece ($45)- Garmin Streetpilot 2730 + RAM Mount + Power Cable ($125)- Extra Large Aprilia Rear Seat with Handles ($75)- SHAD Top Case SH45 + Extra Rear Seat with Mounting Hardware ($300)
WHY SELL IT:I've always wanted a Aprilia and I needed a replacement for my Suzuki TL1000S. The Tuono was the perfect replacement BUT unfortunately the bike does not fit me. This bike handles beautifully but it does not serve me as a Sport Touring bike for traveling long distances. I've invested on adjustable peg and a different handlebar but still not comfortable for a cross-country trip.
THE SALE:Bike is located in Brooklyn most of the time. Some weekends I go visit my family in CT. I have a clean CT Title in hand, ready for transfer. Serious inquiries ONLY! No rides unless cash on hand. NO OFFERS. NO PAYMENT PLANS. Offer emails or calls will be ignored. Emails asking if it is still available will be ignored! You see the ad, then bike is for sale!
Only serious inquiries will be responded.

Posted for sale is my 2005 Suzuki SV1000s. 
Beautiful bike only 7819 miles, bought it about 3 years ago from the original owner with 1900 miles. 

Other than M4 carbon fiber slip ons, aftermarket levers, front turn signals and an integrated rear tailight the bike is stock.  (I still have the stock levers, stock rear taillight and stock rear turn signals)

Freshly changed oil just before season began and new OEM air filter put in last month. The bike is in mint condition, there are no scratches or dings on the bike only normal wear due to age.

I do not need to sell the bike. However, I am looking towards saving for a house and am willing to let go of my bike for the right price. Bike is listed for $3800, I have yet to see another SV1000 this clean and having this few miles. I really love this bike and took pride in taking care of it.

Very rare to see one of these v-twin monsters in this great condition.

Not interested in trades.

2005 Ducati 999 Superbike BLACK Dyno All Receipts

$4850

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Ducati 999 Biposto Testastretta Superbike BLACK Dyno All Receipts.

Title from Florida signed over to me on October 7, 2017. I never registered the Ducati in Connecticut. Rode only 30-miles and kept in my garage with my 1988 Ducati 750 Paso. Chain of Ownership will be documented by transfer of Ownership on the Florida Title that has been signed over to me, and also, a Connecticut Bill of Sale showing exchange of Ownership. Have sold a few Collectible Motorcycles over the years and the Chain-of Ownership documentation is all that is needed to transfer Title.

There are no Leaks, No Smoke, No Excuses, Nothing needed. Out of all the Motorcycles I have owned over the past 40-years, this is the most powerful, lightweight, beautiful, and best designed, as only Italy could have provided. Have owned a 1979 Honda CBX (6-cylinder), a 1978 Benelli 750 SEI (6-cylinder), and 15 others- this Ducati 999 is the BEST, Hands down.

Weighs 402-pounds, Produces 127.64 hp at the rear wheel; 72.51 ft. lbs torque (See DynoJet Performance Output Sheet). Performance is capable of producing more smiles than a face can register. Really.

Have ALL receipts and Service Records, Including the original "Pre-Delivery Checklist".

Also, I do have the Owner's Manual and Red Key. In early 2000 models (up until recently in 2007/08), Ducati motorcycles came with keys that have a specialized anti-theft device. Similar to RFID (key-fobs, electronic strikes), these keys send a unique signal (each key blank will have it's own unique signal) to the motorcycle's computer which are required for operation of the bike using the stock ECU.  Black keys are used to start the bike. When the bike turns on it will read the signal from the black key and a valid signal is required before the bike will start. Red keys are primarily used to program the ECU to accept new signals. It's false that a red key is required for any service on your bike (unless that service is specifically programming new keys into the stock ECU). 

$ 6,000 spent on Service and Upgrades." $ 4,921. spent on 6,000- mile service. Always used Synthetic Oil. Installed Ducati Dynojet Power Commander PC ($ 360), Leo-Vance Cat Eliminator ( $180.), and Leo-Vance Slip-On-Kit ( $ 2,039).

The 6,000 service receipt included:

$3500

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Yamaha YZF-R1 with 9870 miles in great running condition. Bike was laid over on its left side but the left frame slider took the brunt of the fall. It was assessed by Moroney's Cycle of New Windsor, NY and was reported to be left with only cosmetic damage. The damage cost was quoted to be more than the book value of the bike so even though the title is still clean, I will be selling it with the damage disclosure statement checked off on the back of the title, which will render it "rebuilt" once it is registered in the buyer's name. I can provide a copy of the damage estimate to those seriously interested. The bike will pass inspection and ride perfectly. As it sits, it would make the perfect track bike but with new fairings and a tank, it could be a great road bike again too. It could also use a new shifter and left mirror. The engine casing is slightly filed down as well as the swingarm but nothing serious, no cracks. The bike comes with a Scorpion exhaust and a rear tire with low miles on it, as well as a brand new front tire (both Michelin Pilot Power II). Oil changed every 2,000 miles with Mobil 1 full synthetic, ran only 93 octane. Also an anodized gas cap was fitted on the bike so it comes with the OEM cap too. The bike does not come with the stands. 

Very quick machine, technically the lightest of all the R1 generations and very noticeable. Potentially an awesome deal for the right person. 

If serious about the bike, please look at the photos carefully and ask me any questions you might have. NO TRADES will be entertained, CASH ONLY. Thank you!

This is a 2004 Suzuki V Strom DL1000. Its in really nice shape, as you can see in the photos. The engine runs and sounds great. The battery was recently replaced, the fuel injectors were cleaned, and the throttle body was sync'd. The bike has an accessory wire/plug for a heated jacket, and a 12V charger port for your cell or GPS. A few things worth mentioning are: some of the minor/accessory plastics have cracks: the left hand grip guard (see photo), both plastic nuts around the base of the mirrors (they function just fine). I think this is pretty common among V-Stroms. They were there when I got it. Also, the tank has a very small linear dent (also pictured). Bike does not come with the center stand. 

I would consider trades for a civic/corolla or other cars.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking.

I have decided to sell my 2004 Ducati Monster 1000s.  I bought it as an "upgrade" over my 1997 Monster 750 but after 2 summers of riding both, I still prefer my older Duc so it's time to let the newer bike go.  The bike is in nearly pristine condition and runs strong.  It is a very quick bike with fuel injection.  It shares the styling of the original Monsters but without the headache of carbs and that makes it pretty unique in the Monster family.  The bike only has 2689 miles and has received all regular scheduled maintenance.  No scratches on the tank, or tears in the seat.  It has aftermarket Renthal bars but I also have the original stock bars if you want them.  The only thing the bike needs is new front rotors.  The front brakes pulse when stopping: not enough to impair driveability but I find it annoying and would replace the rotors if I were keeping the bike.  Pictures show current condition.

The bike can be inspected at my house on weekends.  It is tagged and insured and can be test driven by serious buyers with appropriate gear.  If you are interested, please reply by email through Craigslist and put "Ducati" in the subject line.

Thanks for looking.

I'm in my 60's and have always been a careful rider.  I'm just not riding enough to own a motorcycle.  It's a super fun bike, and practical for two up touring.  You won't find one in better shape.

Brand new pirelli diablo tires, adjustable lever, Valves, belts, starter, fork seals, Flywheel, Battery, various sensors, oil, all done recently.  The bike has Arrow racing headers ($1000 just for the headers), a custom exhaust and has been tuned and sounds like a bat out of hell.  Turns heads everywhere and a complete joy to ride.  Have various carbon parts and accessories I will include to person who buys. No lowball offers or joyrides without cash in hand.

Bike runs great and the suspension is dialed in perfect. Bike only has 6 track days on it since it was converted. I was able to get the bike to run a 1.33 at NYST. Bike has never been raced but is ready to race if needed.

I've maintained this bike very well, oil changes every 3k miles on the street and every 3-4 track days. I oil/lube all the moving parts on a regular basis. This bike runs strong and does not have any mechanical issues what so ever. As you can see from the pictures the bike is very clean too.

I'm selling this bike because it's a secondary track bike for me and I'm looking to only ride a 600 on the track.

Clean title in hand, only 1 owner. Bike is currently located near Scranton, PA but can be brought down near West Chester, PA or up to NYST depending on the weekend.

This is a garage kept bike most of its life. Has very low miles and that is reflected In the overall shape of the bike. It's runs like a dream and I have not had any problems with it. I've owned it for most of the summer and I've loved riding this bike. I'm selling it because I need the money for other things. Wish I could keep it!!

1000 CC V twin Aprilia Tuono.  Extremely rare and powerful motorcycle with more than enough low end torque and horsepower.  Has a more upright seating position compared to most sport bikes that makes it more comfortable for longer rides, but aggressive and powerful enough to get into the twisties and lift the front wheel in just about any gear if you desire.  All stock with the exception of upgraded Leo Vince exhaust system, cleaner license plate holder, clear turn signal lenses and frame sliders.  Adult owned, garage kept and never laid down.  New rear tire.  Low miles.  Passenger seat and seat cowl included.  Great bike, meticulously maintained, no mechanical issues.  Cash only, no trades.  Test rides with cash in hand.  I'll include front and rear wheel stands for maintenance and an armored leather jacked if interested.  Located in the Mount Vernon area of Alexandria.

Selling my 2005 Kawaski Concours ZG1000. Bike is in impeccable condition. You will have to see it!
23000 miles, always garaged, never down, zero damage, no scratches, no rust! I have owned the bike since 2012 when I purchased it from it's original owner. Purchased as a backup bike she just does not get much use anymore since I don't ride as much as I used to..
Here are some of the things that I have done since I have owned her:
I removed the carbs and had them redone by: https://sites.google.com/site/shoodabenengineering/home
The carbs were cleaned, rejetted, overflow protection installed and sinked. I also purchased their new cams that were installed by Zebra Racing in " Marsh", VA. The bike was dino tuned for maximum efficiency. I am not a speed racer but I enjoy a well running
machine. ( you can read about the tuning philosophy on the shoodabenengineering website (link above).
Since I am 5' 11" with a 34"inseam I made a few further adjustments. 
I installed handlebar risers and lowering pegs as well as handlebar weights. All of that allows the rider to decompress and sit more upright. The bar weights reduce vibration. The bike currently has the short windshield installed (pictured). I do have the original touring windshield as well.
The tires are in great shape, maybe 1500 miles on them.. No maintenance needed, just get on it and ride.
 I hate to see her go but would be happy to see her on the road more often. Will entertain reasonable offers.

I'm selling a 2003 rsv mille. This is a very strong Italian super sport bike. The bike starts and runs great. Shifts smooth every gear. It's a 1000cc, liquid cooled, Vtwin with a 6 speed manual trans. The tires have good life left in them. 23,218 on the odometer. Normal wear and tear on the body. The only thing I see wrong is leaking fork seals. 2003 is the first one only year of the big valve engine in this model motorcycle. It makes the most hp than other year mille. I have a clean title in hand. I'm asking $3500 obo. Any questions please feel free to call or text. Check out my other listings.

I bought it at 30,000 miles. It currently reads 31,807. So far Ive done the following:

• Mobil 1 Full Synthetic Motor Oil
• K&N Oil Filter
• New Air Filter
• NGK Spark Plugs
• New Stator & Regulator Rectifier
• New Battery w/ Warranty
• New Kevlar Brakes on Front & Ceramic on Rear
• 80% Life on Front Tire & 50% Life on Rear Tire

Cons:
• The fairings are primer as of now. I can paint it the color of your choice for an additional $300. Reason it hasn't been painted is because I'm not set on a color yet.

I'm selling it because I personally don't think a 1000cc is for me. It's very nice and fun to ride but I enjoy the 750cc class more. So with that being said, if you have a 06-07 GSXR 750, I'm open for trade, possible cash on top if the bike is in good condition.

The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on or repaired. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it.

I bought it at 30,000 miles. It currently reads 31,807. So far Ive done the following:

• Mobil 1 Full Synthetic Motor Oil
• K&N Oil Filter
• New Air Filter
• NGK Spark Plugs
• New Stator & Regulator Rectifier
• New Battery w/ Warranty
• New Kevlar Brakes on Front & Ceramic on Rear
• 80% Life on Front Tire & 50% Life on Rear Tire

Cons:
• The fairings are primer as of now. I can paint it the color of your choice for an additional $300. Reason it hasn't been painted is because I'm not set on a color yet.

I'm selling it because I personally don't think a 1000cc is for me. It's very nice and fun to ride but I enjoy the 750cc class more. So with that being said, if you have a 06-07 GSXR 750, I'm open for trade, possible cash on top if the bike is in good condition.

I bought it at 30,000 miles. It currently reads 31,807. So far Ive done the following:

• Mobil 1 Full Synthetic Motor Oil
• K&N Oil Filter
• New Air Filter
• NGK Spark Plugs
• New Stator & Regulator Rectifier
• New Battery w/ Warranty
• New Kevlar Brakes on Front & Ceramic on Rear
• 80% Life on Front Tire & 50% Life on Rear Tire

Cons:
• The fairings are primer as of now. I can paint it the color of your choice for an additional $300. Reason it hasn't been painted is because I'm not set on a color yet.

I'm selling it because I personally don't think a 1000cc is for me. It's very nice and fun to ride but I enjoy the 750cc class more. So with that being said, if you have a 06-07 GSXR 750, I'm open for trade, possible cash on top if the bike is in good condition.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it.

This is a clean 2003 SV1000s with 16K miles. Always adult owned, all original, and garage kept.

Everyone is riding a gsxr or ninja. Why not ride something that stands out in a crowd? This is Suzuki's version of a Ducati 900ss or a Honda Superhawk- a V-Twin superbike.

Make me an offer! Will take cash + trade for home defense/hunting items and supplies.

1. Sorry, jeeps, canoes, home stereos, etc, are not home defense items, but thanks anyway.
2. Cash is that green paper stuff that you get when you have a job. Try getting a job first, then make me an offer.
3. If all you have is $1500 you might want to get a scooter. Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

• 13,xxx-ish miles,
• Akropovic exhaust
• Scott's steering stabilizer
• Oil change recently
•Bunch of o-rings, seals, and other gaskets also replaced recently 

Cluster speedo and mileage are inaccurate, everything else works fine, gas light, temp, neutral light, tach light, clock, etc. lol

Bike was laid down by previous owner, he replaced all damaged fairings, bike runs solid I specifically chose this bike for the mileage because I planned on never getting rid of it but i'm ready to see what that cross-plane is all about.

This is a clean 2003 SV1000s with 16K miles. Always adult owned, all original, and garage kept.

Everyone is riding a gsxr or ninja. Why not ride something that stands out in a crowd? This is Suzuki's version of a Ducati 900ss or a Honda Superhawk- a V-Twin superbike.

Make me an offer! Will take cash + trade for home defense/hunting items and supplies.

1. Sorry, jeeps, canoes, home stereos, etc, are not home defense items, but thanks anyway.
2. Cash is that green paper stuff that you get when you have a job. Try getting a job first, then make me an offer.
3. If all you have is $1500 you might want to get a scooter. Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

• 13,xxx-ish miles,
• Akropovic exhaust
• Scott's steering stabilizer
• Oil change recently
•Bunch of o-rings, seals, and other gaskets also replaced recently 

Cluster speedo and mileage are inaccurate, everything else works fine, gas light, temp, neutral light, tach light, clock, etc. lol

Bike was laid down by previous owner, he replaced all damaged fairings, bike runs solid I specifically chose this bike for the mileage because I planned on never getting rid of it but i'm ready to see what that cross-plane is all about.

I bought it at 30,000 miles. It currently reads 31,807. So far Ive done the following:

• Mobil 1 Full Synthetic Motor Oil
• K&N Oil Filter
• New Air Filter
• NGK Spark Plugs
• New Stator & Regulator Rectifier
• New Battery w/ Warranty
• New Kevlar Brakes on Front & Ceramic on Rear
• 80% Life on Front Tire & 50% Life on Rear Tire

Cons:
• The fairings are primer as of now. I can paint it the color of your choice for an additional $300. Reason it hasn't been painted is because I'm not set on a color yet.

I'm selling it because I personally don't think a 1000cc is for me. It's very nice and fun to ride but I enjoy the 750cc class more. So with that being said, if you have a 06-07 GSXR 750, I'm open for trade, possible cash on top if the bike is in good condition.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it.

Will consider trades for a small fishing boat, 4-Wheeler (quad), or Ranger side-by-side, 64-75 Chevy Pickup, gas golf cart, the right home defense items (with proper Bill of Sale), Jeep, small camper, or maybe your trade plus cash.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it.

Will consider trades for a small fishing boat, 4-Wheeler (quad), or Ranger side-by-side, 64-75 Chevy Pickup, gas golf cart, the right home defense items (with proper Bill of Sale), Jeep, small camper, or maybe your trade plus cash.

• 13,xxx-ish miles,
• Akropovic exhaust
• Scott's steering stabilizer
• Oil change recently
•Bunch of o-rings, seals, and other gaskets also replaced recently 

Cluster speedo and mileage are inaccurate, everything else works fine, gas light, temp, neutral light, tach light, clock, etc. lol

Bike was laid down by previous owner, he replaced all damaged fairings, bike runs solid I specifically chose this bike for the mileage because I planned on never getting rid of it but i'm ready to see what that cross-plane is all about.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on or repaired. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it. 

Details:

2005 Buell XB9SX in Hero Translucent Blue:

984cc Air/Oil Cooled V-Twin
180mm Rear Tire

LED Slim Front and Rear Turn Signals
Fairly New Brake Pads ( Less than 5k miles on them including full brake fluid flush)
New Battery this year (2018)
Silverstar Hi/Low beam Bulbs
50+ Miles to the Gallon 


$4,000 OBO. Make me an offer... Will consider trades for a small fishing boat, 4-Wheeler (quad), or Ranger side-by-side, 64-75 Chevy Pickup, Gas Golf Cart, the right home defense items (with proper Bill of Sale), Jeep, Small Camper, or maybe your trade plus cash.

I bought it at 30,000 miles. It currently reads 31,807. So far Ive done the following:

• Mobil 1 Full Synthetic Motor Oil
• K&N Oil Filter
• New Air Filter
• NGK Spark Plugs
• New Stator & Regulator Rectifier
• New Battery w/ Warranty
• New Kevlar Brakes on Front & Ceramic on Rear
• 80% Life on Front Tire & 50% Life on Rear Tire

Cons:
• The fairings are primer as of now. I can paint it the color of your choice for an additional $300. Reason it hasn't been painted is because I'm not set on a color yet.

I'm selling it because I personally don't think a 1000cc is for me. It's very nice and fun to ride but I enjoy the 750cc class more. So with that being said, if you have a 06-07 GSXR 750, I'm open for trade, possible cash on top if the bike is in good condition.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it. 

Details:

984cc Air/Oil Cooled V-Twin

$4,000 OBO. Make me an offer... Will consider trades for a small fishing boat, 4-Wheeler (quad), or Ranger side-by-side, 64-75 Chevy Pickup, gas golf cart, the right home defense items (with proper Bill of Sale), Jeep, small camper, or maybe your trade plus cash.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on or repaired. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it.

Make me an offer! Will take cash + trade for home defense/hunting items and supplies.

1. Sorry, jeeps, canoes, home stereos, etc, are not home defense items, but thanks anyway.
2. Cash is that green paper stuff that you get when you have a job. Try getting a job first, then make me an offer.

Cluster speedo and mileage are inaccurate, everything else works fine, gas light, temp, neutral light, tach light, clock, etc. lol

Bike was laid down by previous owner, he replaced all damaged fairings, bike runs solid I specifically chose this bike for the mileage because I planned on never getting rid of it but i'm ready to see what that cross-plane is all about.

Everyone is riding a gsxr or ninja. Why not ride something that stands out in a crowd? This is Suzuki's version of a Ducati 900ss or a Honda Superhawk- a V-Twin superbike.

Make me an offer! Will take cash + trade for home defense/hunting items and supplies.

1. Sorry, jeeps, canoes, home stereos, etc, are not home defense items, but thanks anyway.
2. Cash is that green paper stuff that you get when you have a job. Try getting a job first, then make me an offer.
3. If all you have is $1500 you might want to get a scooter. Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

Cleanest SV1000 from Melbourne to Jacksonville! 

2003 Suzuki SV1000S with only 16,000 miles, always adult owned, garage kept, and NO modifications. All original and ready to ride.

Big brother to the SV650 but still easy to ride. Suzuki's version of a Ducati or Honda Superhawk.

Everyone else is riding a ninja or gsxr. Why not ride something that stands out in a crowd?

Will take partial trade for cash + home defense items/supplies. Make me an offer!

1. Sorry, jeeps, canoes, home stereos, etc, are not home defense items, but thanks anyway.
2. Cash is that green paper stuff that you get when you have a job. Try getting a job first, then make me an offer.
3. If all you have is $1500 you might want to get a scooter. Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on or repaired. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it. 

Details:

2005 Buell XB9SX in Hero Translucent Blue:

984cc Air/Oil Cooled V-Twin
180mm Rear Tire
License Plate Relocate
Blue LED's 
K&N Filter
Snorkel Snip MOD (Much better airflow from the intake)
Matching Handlebar Grips
Hero Translucent Blue Air Box Cover
LED Slim Front and Rear Turn Signals
Fairly New Brake Pads ( Less than 5k miles on them including full brake fluid flush)
New Battery this year (2018)
Silverstar Hi/Low beam Bulbs
50+ Miles to the Gallon 


$4,000 OBO. Make me an offer... Will consider trades for a small fishing boat, 4-Wheeler (quad), or Ranger side-by-side, 64-75 Chevy Pickup, Gas Golf Cart, the right home defense items (with proper Bill of Sale), Jeep, Small Camper, or maybe your trade plus cash. Let me know what you have and I'll let you know if I'm interested.

Make me an offer! Will take cash + trade for home defense/hunting items and supplies.

1. Sorry, jeeps, canoes, home stereos, etc, are not home defense items, but thanks anyway.
2. Cash is that green paper stuff that you get when you have a job. Try getting a job first, then make me an offer.
3. If all you have is $1500 you might want to get a scooter. Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

Bike was laid down by previous owner, he replaced all damaged fairings, bike runs solid I specifically chose this bike for the mileage because I planned on never getting rid of it but i'm ready to see what that cross-plane is all about.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on or repaired. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it.

I bought it at 30,000 miles. It currently reads 31,807. So far Ive done the following:

• Mobil 1 Full Synthetic Motor Oil
• K&N Oil Filter
• New Air Filter
• NGK Spark Plugs
• New Stator & Regulator Rectifier
• New Battery w/ Warranty
• New Kevlar Brakes on Front & Ceramic on Rear
• 80% Life on Front Tire & 50% Life on Rear Tire

Cons:
• The fairings are primer as of now. I can paint it the color of your choice for an additional $300. Reason it hasn't been painted is because I'm not set on a color yet.

I'm selling it because I personally don't think a 1000cc is for me. It's very nice and fun to ride but I enjoy the 750cc class more. So with that being said, if you have a 06-07 GSXR 750, I'm open for trade, possible cash on top if the bike is in good condition.

This is a clean 2003 SV1000s with 16K miles. Always adult owned, all original, and garage kept.

Everyone is riding a gsxr or ninja. Why not ride something that stands out in a crowd? This is Suzuki's version of a Ducati 900ss or a Honda Superhawk- a V-Twin superbike.

Make me an offer! Will take cash + trade for home defense/hunting items and supplies.

1. Sorry, jeeps, canoes, home stereos, etc, are not home defense items, but thanks anyway.
2. Cash is that green paper stuff that you get when you have a job. Try getting a job first, then make me an offer.
3. If all you have is $1500 you might want to get a scooter. Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

• 13,xxx-ish miles,

• Scott's steering stabilizer
• Oil change recently
•Bunch of o-rings, seals, and other gaskets also replaced recently 

Cluster speedo and mileage are inaccurate, everything else works fine, gas light, temp, neutral light, tach light, clock, etc. lol

Bike was laid down by previous owner, he replaced all damaged fairings, bike runs solid I specifically chose this bike for the mileage because I planned on never getting rid of it but i'm ready to see what that cross-plane is all about.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on or repaired. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it.

Will consider trades for a small fishing boat, 4-Wheeler (quad), or Ranger side-by-side, 64-75 Chevy Pickup, Gas Golf Cart, the right home defense items (with proper Bill of Sale), Jeep, Small Camper, or maybe your trade plus cash.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it.

Big brother to the SV650 but still easy to ride. Suzuki's version of a Ducati or Honda Superhawk.

Everyone else is riding a ninja or gsxr. Why not ride something that stands out in a crowd?

Will take partial trade for cash + home defense items/supplies. Make me an offer!

1. Sorry, jeeps, canoes, home stereos, etc, are not home defense items, but thanks anyway.
2. Cash is that green paper stuff that you get when you have a job. Try getting a job first, then make me an offer.
3. If all you have is $1500 you might want to get a scooter. Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

Stock everything, no front turn signals. 1000 cc. SV series motorcycle 1000S. Hybrid crotch rocket with a v- twin engine. Plenty of torque, speed and fun. $3500 OBO.

Call or text me to view this beautiful motorcycle. 

May consider trade for Chevy S10 (pre-1995) or toyota motorhome.

This is a clean 2003 SV1000s with 16K miles. Always adult owned, all original, and garage kept.

Everyone is riding a gsxr or ninja. Why not ride something that stands out in a crowd? This is Suzuki's version of a Ducati 900ss or a Honda Superhawk- a V-Twin superbike.

Make me an offer! Will take cash + trade for home defense/hunting items and supplies.

1. Sorry, jeeps, canoes, home stereos, etc, are not home defense items, but thanks anyway.
2. Cash is that green paper stuff that you get when you have a job. Try getting a job first, then make me an offer.
3. If all you have is $1500 you might want to get a scooter. Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

Cluster speedo and mileage are inaccurate, everything else works fine, gas light, temp, neutral light, tach light, clock, etc. lol

Bike was laid down by previous owner, he replaced all damaged fairings, bike runs solid I specifically chose this bike for the mileage because I planned on never getting rid of it but i'm ready to see what that cross-plane is all about.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on or repaired. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it.

Will consider trades for a small fishing boat, 4-Wheeler (quad), or Ranger side-by-side, 64-75 Chevy Pickup, Gas Golf Cart, the right home defense items (with proper Bill of Sale), Jeep, Small Camper, or maybe your trade plus cash.

I bought it at 30,000 miles. It currently reads 31,807. So far Ive done the following:

• Mobil 1 Full Synthetic Motor Oil
• K&N Oil Filter
• New Air Filter
• NGK Spark Plugs
• New Stator & Regulator Rectifier
• New Battery w/ Warranty
• New Kevlar Brakes on Front & Ceramic on Rear
• 80% Life on Front Tire & 50% Life on Rear Tire

Cons:
• The fairings are primer as of now. I can paint it the color of your choice for an additional $300. Reason it hasn't been painted is because I'm not set on a color yet.

I'm selling it because I personally don't think a 1000cc is for me. It's very nice and fun to ride but I enjoy the 750cc class more. So with that being said, if you have a 06-07 GSXR 750, I'm open for trade, possible cash on top if the bike is in good condition.

This is a clean 2003 SV1000s with 16K miles. Always adult owned, all original, and garage kept.

Everyone is riding a gsxr or ninja. Why not ride something that stands out in a crowd? This is Suzuki's version of a Ducati 900ss or a Honda Superhawk- a V-Twin superbike.

Make me an offer! Will take cash + trade for home defense/hunting items and supplies.

1. Sorry, jeeps, canoes, home stereos, etc, are not home defense items, but thanks anyway.
2. Cash is that green paper stuff that you get when you have a job. Try getting a job first, then make me an offer.
3. If all you have is $1500 you might want to get a scooter. Everyone's gotta start somewhere.

Do you think it's possible to buy a $6,500 bike for less than $600?

Few bikes here are just scams. 

If looks too good to be true, isn't. 

Don't fall for B.S.

• 13,xxx-ish miles,
• Akropovic exhaust
• Scott's steering stabilizer
• Oil change recently
•Bunch of o-rings, seals, and other gaskets also replaced recently 

Cluster speedo and mileage are inaccurate, everything else works fine, gas light, temp, neutral light, tach light, clock, etc. lol

Bike was laid down by previous owner, he replaced all damaged fairings, bike runs solid I specifically chose this bike for the mileage because I planned on never getting rid of it but i'm ready to see what that cross-plane is all about.

I bought it at 30,000 miles. It currently reads 31,807. So far Ive done the following:

• Mobil 1 Full Synthetic Motor Oil
• K&N Oil Filter
• New Air Filter
• NGK Spark Plugs
• New Stator & Regulator Rectifier
• New Battery w/ Warranty
• New Kevlar Brakes on Front & Ceramic on Rear
• 80% Life on Front Tire & 50% Life on Rear Tire

Cons:
• The fairings are primer as of now. I can paint it the color of your choice for an additional $300. Reason it hasn't been painted is because I'm not set on a color yet.

I'm selling it because I personally don't think a 1000cc is for me. It's very nice and fun to ride but I enjoy the 750cc class more. So with that being said, if you have a 06-07 GSXR 750, I'm open for trade, possible cash on top if the bike is in good condition.

Great bike that needs nothing.  Recent valve adjustment and new belts, termignoni exhaust, and Barnett clutch.  The ds series is the most reliable engine Ducati made.  The 2 valve air cooled engine pumps out 92 hp and tons of torque.  I have the owners manual, two regular keys, and the red program key.

This is the practical alternative solution to a supermoto.

2003 Suzuki TL100R that is unique in its own way. Best of both worlds between a sports bike and a v-twin. The unique sound always turns heads.

This is my 2nd TLR. Purchased it a few years ago and have ridden it around TN,GA, AL, NC and SC. I have a cruiser too and just do not ride this that often. I have added  HealTech FI Turner Pro and Gear Indicator with TRE, Eastern Beaver Headlight Relay mod, updated the common issue with the ground and rectifier, added a headlight bypass switch with USB and 12v cig charger, and K&N Air Filter. The exhaust is from a TLS and the internals modified for better sound. Bike has been ridden so normal scuffs on paint.  No rides unless cash in hand, you drop or damage, it is your bike.

Two common things are going on with this bike.
1. Stator needs to be replaced. Battery will not stay charged if riding at night or with headlight on during the day in stop and go traffic. On the hwy you are good.
2. The left fork seal is leaking.

I'm an older guy and 2nd owner - this bike has never been down, raced, abused, stunted, etc.  It's in excellent condition.  Spark Plugs just replaced (this over $200), good tires (Michelin Power Pilot) ready to roll. Front fairing is not the original - it cracked right at the mirror but I still have it so you can see the bike was not laid down.

Great bike that needs nothing.  Recent valve adjustment and new belts, termignoni exhaust, and Barnett clutch.  The ds series is the most reliable engine Ducati made.  The 2 valve air cooled engine pumps out 92 hp and tons of torque.  I have the owners manual, two regular keys, and the red program key.

This is the practical alternative solution to a supermoto.

2003 Suzuki TL100R that is unique in its own way. Best of both worlds between a sports bike and a v-twin. The unique sound always turns heads.

This is my 2nd TLR. Purchased it a few years ago and have ridden it around TN,GA, AL, NC and SC. I have a cruiser too and just do not ride this that often. I have added  HealTech FI Turner Pro and Gear Indicator with TRE, Eastern Beaver Headlight Relay mod, updated the common issue with the ground and rectifier, added a headlight bypass switch with USB and 12v cig charger, and K&N Air Filter. The exhaust is from a TLS and the internals modified for better sound. Bike has been ridden so normal scuffs on paint.  No rides unless cash in hand, you drop or damage, it is your bike.

Two common things are going on with this bike.
1. Stator needs to be replaced. Battery will not stay charged if riding at night or with headlight on during the day in stop and go traffic. On the hwy you are good.
2. The left fork seal is leaking.

Finally letting go of my favorite bike of all time.  This is a 2003 Yamaha R1 with Ohlins front suspension, FULL Akrapovic titanium exhaust, power commander, steering stabilizer, and only 14,000 miles.  I'm an older guy and 2nd owner - this bike has never been down, raced, abused, stunted, etc.  It's in excellent condition.  Spark Plugs just replaced (this over $200), good tires (Michelin Power Pilot) ready to roll. Front fairing is not the original - it cracked right at the mirror but I still have it so you can see the bike was not laid down.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it. 

Details:

2005 Buell XB9SX in Hero Translucent Blue:

984cc Air/Oil Cooled V-Twin
180mm Rear Tire
License Plate Relocate
Blue LED's 
K&N Filter

LED Slim Front and Rear Turn Signals
Fairly New Brake Pads ( Less than 5k miles on them including full brake fluid flush)
New Battery this year (2018)
Silverstar Hi/Low beam Bulbs
50+ Miles to the Gallon 


$4,000 OBO. Make me an offer... Will consider trades for a small fishing boat, 4-Wheeler (quad), or Ranger side-by-side, 64-75 Chevy Pickup, gas golf cart, the right home defense items (with proper Bill of Sale), Jeep, small camper, or maybe your trade plus cash. Let me know what you have and I'll let you know if I'm interested.

The 2 valve air cooled engine pumps out 92 hp and tons of torque.  I have the owners manual, two regular keys, and the red program key.

This is my 2nd TLR. Purchased it a few years ago and have ridden it around TN,GA, AL, NC and SC. I have a cruiser too and just do not ride this that often. I have added  HealTech FI Turner Pro and Gear Indicator with TRE, Eastern Beaver Headlight Relay mod, updated the common issue with the ground and rectifier, added a headlight bypass switch with USB and 12v cig charger, and K&N Air Filter. The exhaust is from a TLS and the internals modified for better sound. Bike has been ridden so normal scuffs on paint.  No rides unless cash in hand, you drop or damage, it is your bike.

Two common things are going on with this bike.
1. Stator needs to be replaced. Battery will not stay charged if riding at night or with headlight on during the day in stop and go traffic. On the hwy you are good.
2. The left fork seal is leaking.

Finally letting go of my favorite bike of all time.  This is a 2003 Yamaha R1 with Ohlins front suspension, FULL Akrapovic titanium exhaust, power commander, steering stabilizer, and only 14,000 miles.  I'm an older guy and 2nd owner - this bike has never been down, raced, abused, stunted, etc.  It's in excellent condition.  Spark Plugs just replaced (this over $200), good tires (Michelin Power Pilot) ready to roll. Front fairing is not the original - it cracked right at the mirror but I still have it so you can see the bike was not laid down.

Great bike that needs nothing.  Recent valve adjustment and new belts, termignoni exhaust, and Barnett clutch.  The ds series is the most reliable engine Ducati made.  The 2 valve air cooled engine pumps out 92 hp and tons of torque.  I have the owners manual, two regular keys, and the red program key.

This is the practical alternative solution to a supermoto.

This is a low miles dream of a Buell and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't ride much anymore and it deserves a home that will ride her more often.

This is a mechanic special!
2002 Suzuki V-Strom DL1000 that I purchased in 2007 with 13,637 miles.  Current mileage is approximately 17,500.  The display works but with the fuel pump removed it will not display odometer reading.  Tires have about 900 miles on them.  Bike has been garage kept.  Fuel tank was removed because of bad fuel and I never got back to repairing it/putting it back together and I am selling as is.  The blue tape on fuel tank is protecting the original paint as I repainted the rest of the tank.  Tank has been resealed and bike may need a new fuel pump.  To my knowledge, all removed parts/hardware have been saved and will be provided to new owner.  Before fuel contamination the bike road great and everything worked perfectly.  Previous owner did lay it down on left side and caused cosmetic damage only.  Scratches on the left fairing can be seen in the pictures.  Not pictured are two Suzuki hard bags, one for each side.  It has been sitting for approximately 5 years.  Title is clear, in hand, and not a salvage title.  Cash only sale and buyer must pick up.  Located in E. Brainerd, Chattanooga TN.  Please ask any questions.  $2,000 OBO

Great bike that needs nothing.  Recent valve adjustment and new belts, termignoni exhaust, and Barnett clutch.  The ds series is the most reliable engine Ducati made.  The 2 valve air cooled engine pumps out 92 hp and tons of torque.  I have the owners manual, two regular keys, and the red program key.

2003 Suzuki TL100R that is unique in its own way. Best of both worlds between a sports bike and a v-twin. The unique sound always turns heads.

This is my 2nd TLR. Purchased it a few years ago and have ridden it around TN,GA, AL, NC and SC. I have a cruiser too and just do not ride this that often. I have added  HealTech FI Turner Pro and Gear Indicator with TRE, Eastern Beaver Headlight Relay mod, updated the common issue with the ground and rectifier, added a headlight bypass switch with USB and 12v cig charger, and K&N Air Filter. The exhaust is from a TLS and the internals modified for better sound. Bike has been ridden so normal scuffs on paint.  No rides unless cash in hand, you drop or damage, it is your bike.

Two common things are going on with this bike.
1. Stator needs to be replaced. Battery will not stay charged if riding at night or with headlight on during the day in stop and go traffic. On the hwy you are good.
2. The left fork seal is leaking.

Finally letting go of my favorite bike of all time.  This is a 2003 Yamaha R1 with Ohlins front suspension, FULL Akrapovic titanium exhaust, power commander, steering stabilizer, and only 14,000 miles.  I'm an older guy and 2nd owner - this bike has never been down, raced, abused, stunted, etc.  It's in excellent condition.  Spark Plugs just replaced (this over $200), good tires (Michelin Power Pilot) ready to roll. Front fairing is not the original - it cracked right at the mirror but I still have it so you can see the bike was not laid down.

I have a 2008 CBR 1000 for sale or trade. I really love this bike but I just dont ride it anymore. The bike looks great and runs great. It has a power commander on it, and Toce exhaust. It also has frame-sliders, tinted windscreen and still has a lot of tread on the tires. I just had a fresh oil change done at a shop so its good to go. The bike reads 25k miles but was geared at 14k. Its never been down. I'm asking 4800obo.  There's not a thing wrong with this bike I just don't ride it anymore. I'm willing to entertain certain trades I'm wanting a classic car, maybe a project car if its the right car. The cars I'm really after are 1965-69 Impala, and cars of similar bodies like the Bel Air. May also trade for a built motor, just offer, worst thing I can say is no.  Text me anytime at  show contact info

If you are seeing this ad, the bike is still available. Excellent condition. No trades or low-ballers please.  

This is a Yamaha FZ1, with upright seating position but with sportbike performance. Weighs only 459 pounds, making it a nimble sport-touring machine. 1000cc and 140+ horsepower, 0-60 in 3 seconds, sharp handling. Perfect for touring, spins in the mountains, or around town. Givi top case and new battery. Billeted peg lowering kit, Daytona bars, and road sprockets have all been installed to improve riding posture and handling. It starts, runs, and handles perfectly. Never wrecked, adult ridden, original exhaust, synthetic oil, always garaged. This carbureted FZ1 has much smoother throttle response than the fuel injected versions. (Carbs recently cleaned by experienced mechanic). Swing arm bearings were changed about 2000 miles ago. A wonderful bike that will take you anywhere. Best serious offer.

What you see is a 2002 Yamaha R1 had it for a couple years now been nothing but great to me almost every nut and bolt on this bike has been gone through. Definitely not a beginner bike so please don't show up if you've never owned a street bike.. pros stretched 8 inches lowered 2 ,new spring and gas shock canister. New Plastics all the way around, new friction plates clutch plates  and clutch basket  there in egk stage 2 ,stage 2 mild cam, Power Commander 3 the full ECU hook up not just the Plug and Play ,long tube headers with a M4 shorty Muffler. Chrome polish brake and clutch levers, pegs .  Brand new Dunlop drag radial front tire and  decent  power core 3 Continental rear .Cons- second gear slips from time to time new trans rail is 160 and it's not that bad of an install price check yourself if you feel like . With that being said this bike has been to the track many times. This is the cause of the second gear slip only in low end from a dig first through 6 Full Throttle no problem no slip. Asking 3 Grand bottom price or trade for something stick that's not a shitbox. Bike is very well worth it it speaks for itself not in a rush to sell

Not your typical 2005 SV1000S!

This bike was bought a few years ago by me with a fairing delete and a Buell style front end. This was not a hack job and is well put together.
Additional Modifications
-Power Commander
-Aftermarket Brake and Clutch Levers
-Custom Undertail Exhaust
-Oil Filter Adapter
-Full Lighting on the whole bike 
-Larger Rear Sprocket
This bike looks completely different than stock and has zero issues.
Oil change completed 1000 miles ago and New Pirelli Diablo Rosso ll Tirea as well with a new Chain and Sprockets.

This bike is an absolute blast to drive and is very fast due to the gobs of torque it produces. Have to be careful of the front wheel coming up in most gears and is comparable in speed to an R6. Not a great beginner bike, but easy to predict the Power.

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it.

Will consider trades for a small fishing boat, 4-Wheeler (quad), or Ranger side-by-side, 64-75 Chevy Pickup, gas golf cart, the right home defense items (with proper Bill of Sale), Jeep, small camper, or maybe your trade plus cash.

Not your typical 2005 SV1000S!

This bike was bought a few years ago by me with a fairing delete and a Buell style front end. This was not a hack job and is well put together.
Additional Modifications
-Power Commander
-Aftermarket Brake and Clutch Levers
-Custom Undertail Exhaust
-Oil Filter Adapter
-Full Lighting on the whole bike 
-Larger Rear Sprocket
This bike looks completely different than stock and has zero issues.
Oil change completed 1000 miles ago and New Pirelli Diablo Rosso ll Tirea as well with a new Chain and Sprockets.

This bike is an absolute blast to drive and is very fast due to the gobs of torque it produces. Have to be careful of the front wheel coming up in most gears and is comparable in speed to an R6. Not a great beginner bike, but easy to predict the Power. 
Text if interested!

I am the original owner of this motorcycle, and only put 18,890 miles on her. Always garage kept and always serviced using AmsOil Synthetic MC oil. The tires have a little life in them but will at least need a rear in the future. This bike is in GREAT condition but does have a few blemishes from being knocked over in public, and the right side tail section is cracked right where one of the passenger peg brackets would mount. I never worried about it since I RARELY rode a passenger and doesn't affect the integrity of the bike AT ALL, nor is it part of the frame. The brackets can still be mounted and used but with caution on that side until a new right side section is put on. It really isn't a big deal, but I wanted to be up front about it. Come see it up close if it's the only thing putting you on the fence. (See Pics) Also comes with the passenger peg brackets, bike cover, Owners Manual, and anything else I might find to go with it. 

Details:

New Battery this year (2018)
Silverstar Hi/Low beam Bulbs
50+ Miles to the Gallon 

$4,000 OBO. Make me an offer... Will consider trades for a small fishing boat, 4-Wheeler (quad), or Ranger side-by-side, 64-75 Chevy Pickup, gas golf cart, the right home defense items (with proper Bill of Sale), Jeep, small camper, or maybe your trade plus cash.

Due to living/moving situation. I need an actual vehicle and not a crotch rocket. Though, I'm in no rush in selling it. I truly love this beast. Just bought this bike in August brand new. Just passed the 1500 mile mark. Oil changes and maintained at 800. Very well taken care of.

I'm still financing the bike, so I'm looking for someone that's willing to pay my lease off and keep for your own. 

Please, no waste my time. Even though we all on Hayn time. Mahalo.

Brand new front tire, fairly new rear, brand new chain. Aftermarket very bright led flood lights professionally installed. Usb charging port professionally installed. 23xxx miles, i still ride it so the number will vary. The oil changes and other maintenance have been done religiously. Its a powerful bike, not for beginners. I rode this baby all the way from florida and it never gave me a single problem (other than a flat). Very fun to ride, quite comfortable. Im looking to buy a car for the trip back so my baby needs to go to another good home. Theres some cosmetic damage, some was there when I bought it. The clutch case has a scrape on it. The cowl is cracked by the right headlight, and the front fender is also cracked. Price is negotiable. Test rides are an option with endorsement.

2002 Honda RC51, Nicky Hayden model. This is a rare model that celebrates Nicky winning the 2002 AMA championship. Especially since Nicky has passed away. This is the SP2, second generation with larger throttle bodies and lighter swingarm.

I am asking $3100 OBO.
The best way to contact me is to text 
Lawrence @928- four eight six- 74one seven. I am not interested in any trades. To test ride, must have full asking price in cash and motorcycle endorsement on license. Do not need help selling. This is a serious sport bike and is absolutely not for beginners.

Fantastic deal on a project midnight blue sport touring bike.  A ruptured coolant hose caused a brief overheating that created an oil to coolant leak.  The likely cause is a head gasket, warped or cracked head.  This is only speculation since the engine has not been torn down.  After the ruptured hose was replaced and the coolant refilled, the engine ran with normal power, sound, temperature, fuel economy (approx 38 mpg), etc. and seemed completely normal.  The oil leak was discovered while getting ready to replace the rest of the coolant hoses.

If the problem turns out worse than a warped head / head gasket, several used engines can be found on eBay for around $300.  The offered price gives you an opportunity to be in this bike for well under the typical price of $2000 - $3000.

There is some damage to the cowlings (minor cracks) from the previous owner and a small scratch on the gas tank.

This bike includes a new $330 Madstad Engineering adjustable windshield that splits the airflow to balance pressure which significantly reduces turbulence and noise at highway speeds.

This has Metzler ME 888 Marathon Ultra tires.  The rear has only 1000 miles on it.  The front has about 1/2 of its tread left.  These amazing tires deliver over 10,000 miles of life for the rear and up to 20,000 miles for the front.

The hand grip warmers are powered through a solenoid that automatically cuts off power when the bike is off to protect the battery from being accidentally left on.

This fun bike has always been stored in a garage.

7.5 Gal Fuel Tank provides a range of over 250 miles

95.5 horsepower at around 9,000 rpm. The pulling power peaks at about 6,000 rpm where the maximum torque of 65.7 lb-ft is reached. There's still plenty of pulling strength, anywhere between 3,000 to 9,000 rpm range, as the engine was designed to keep a fairly high torque between the top four of the six gears.

ENGINE:  
Engine Type	 Horizontal In-line
Cylinders	 4
Engine Stroke	 4-Stroke
Cooling	 Liquid
Valves	 16
Valves Per Cylinder	 4
Valve Configuration	 DOHC
Compression Ratio	 10.2:1

TRANSMISSION:  
Transmission Type	 Manual
Number Of Speeds	 6
Primary Drive (Rear Wheel)	 Shaft

For the right price, I would be willing to deliver the bike to you.

I have an 05 R1 i'm looking to sell. I have a loan on the bike so would have to go to the bank when buying to get the title. The bike has roughly 30,000 miles. It's stretched 6inches and lowered 3inches, powercommander 3, new high performance clutch which was just installed 1000 miles ago and obviously oil was changed then too. The sprockets and chain were just replaced a few weeks ago. Tires are in good condition, the back breaks aren't the best right now but I will be changing them in the next week. $3600.

For sale is a 2010 Kawasaki Z1000.  It is a naked sport bike.  It has a 1000cc 4 cylinder motor.  It has 1800 miles.  It has a power commander installed.  The stock exhaust has been replaced with Vance Hines dual pipes on each side of the bike.  It was purchased in 2012 brand new.  It sat in the showroom floor since 2010.  I am selling because my days of the sport bike may have come to an end as I am getting more into custom bikes.  This is a great bike with low miles and unique.  It's not a ninja but is more comfortable than a ninja and does all the same things a ninja or the comparables do.

12k miles but still riding so may be a bit higher. 
It's in decent shape used, not abused. Same mechanics as a Firebolt XB9 with slightly more relaxed
rider position with taller bars and different saddle, Different lights and fairing than the firebolt.
I added a small tail bag, bar end mirrors and different grips. Mechanics are all stock and tires are OK.
The XB9 bikes were designed by Erik Buell and made by Harley Davidson with a 883cc Sportster engine 
but displacement is 883cc

Asking $2900. flexible and will consider serious offers.
Test ride is OK with full cash deposit

Let me start by saying I purchased this bike April 2015 with 4,730 miles. It currently has 8,4xx miles (less than 1,000 miles per season). Beginning of every season bike was always inspected by Monster Powersports in Wauconda and always went with full synthetic oil changes. Brakes and tires have plenty of life left. Two Brothers slip-on exhaust and aftermarket tinted windscreen. Aside from that it's bone stock. Always stored in a heated warehouse. Never stunted, never crashed.

For sale is a 2006 Kawasaki ZX-10R with 26k miles. This bike has been maintained very well and just had recent service with us including fresh oil and filter, new front and rear brake pads, and brand new Continental tires. It does have some minor cosmetic damage on the tank and right fairing but overall the bike is in great shape and is very strong mechanically. This bike has some modifications and is very powerful, the catalytic converter has been deleted and the twin mufflers under the seat have been swapped for a very nice Competition Werkes muffler that sheds a significant amount of weight and brings the center of gravity closer to the ground, which improves handling. It's been tuned for these mods by a reputable local shop and put down 161WHP on the dyno, and we have the sheet to go with the bike. This beautiful Ninja is available for viewing 7 days a week at Top Gear Powersports in Roselle, please call or stop by with any questions or inquiries.

For sale is my 2006 Suzuki SV 1000S. I don't get time to ride it anymore with my job, so there's no point in keeping it around. It has a clean title, and I've owned it for about 5 years with no problems. I also have a rear seat, and the bar that goes behind the rear seat. It has a recent oil change as well. 

For any test rides, you'll have to have cash on hand. Before you can take it out, I'll want a copy of your license and insurance. If you do want to test ride it, you'll also need an M endorsement on your license.

Clean title, in hand.

For sale is a 2010 Kawasaki Z1000.  It is a naked sport bike.  It has a 1000cc 4 cylinder motor.  It has 1800 miles.  It has a power commander installed.  The stock exhaust has been replaced with Vance Hines dual pipes on each side of the bike.  It was purchased in 2012 brand new.  It sat in the showroom floor since 2010.  I am selling because my days of the sport bike may have come to an end as I am getting more into custom bikes.  This is a great bike with low miles and unique.  It's not a ninja but is more comfortable than a ninja and does all the same things a ninja or the comparables do.

12k miles but still riding so may be a bit higher. 
It's in decent shape used, not abused. Same mechanics as a Firebolt XB9 with slightly more relaxed
rider position with taller bars and different saddle, Different lights and fairing than the firebolt.
I added a small tail bag, bar end mirrors and different grips. Mechanics are all stock and tires are OK.
The XB9 bikes were designed by Erik Buell and made by Harley Davidson with a 883cc Sportster engine 
but displacement is 883cc

Asking $2900. flexible and will consider serious offers.
Test ride is OK with full cash deposit

Just like the R1, the FZ1 has set the standard for sporting street motorcycles. Providing compromised performance in a comfortable, all-around package. So, everything you've just read about this bike holds true, the handling, smooth ride, plenty of torque and power. With only 8400 original miles and adult driven, there's plenty of life in this bike. There are some cosmetic issues, hardly noticeable unless they were pointed out to you. few minor scratches, I've had this bike and been Riding it since 2007, the bike is all original. $2400 Or Best Offer No Trades

Let me start by saying I purchased this bike April 2015 with 4,730 miles. It currently has 8,4xx miles (less than 1,000 miles per season). Beginning of every season bike was always inspected by Monster Powersports in Wauconda and always went with full synthetic oil changes. Brakes and tires have plenty of life left. Two Brothers slip-on exhaust and aftermarket tinted windscreen. Aside from that it's bone stock. Always stored in a heated warehouse. Never stunted, never crashed. 


$5k FIRM

Clean and clear title in hand. No test rides without cash in hand.

For sale is a 2006 Kawasaki ZX-10R with 26k miles. This bike has been maintained very well and just had recent service with us including fresh oil and filter, new front and rear brake pads, and brand new Continental tires. It does have some minor cosmetic damage on the tank and right fairing but overall the bike is in great shape and is very strong mechanically. This bike has some modifications and is very powerful, the catalytic converter has been deleted and the twin mufflers under the seat have been swapped for a very nice Competition Werkes muffler that sheds a significant amount of weight and brings the center of gravity closer to the ground, which improves handling. It's been tuned for these mods by a reputable local shop and put down 161WHP on the dyno, and we have the sheet to go with the bike. This beautiful Ninja is available for viewing 7 days a week at Top Gear Powersports in Roselle, please call or stop by with any questions or inquiries.

It's stretched 6inches and lowered 3inches, powercommander 3, new high performance clutch which was just installed 1000 miles ago and obviously oil was changed then too. The sprockets and chain were just replaced a few weeks ago. Tires are in good condition, the back breaks aren't the best right now but I will be changing them in the next week. $3600.

I have an 05 R1 i'm looking to sell. I have a loan on the bike so would have to go to the bank when buying to get the title. The bike has roughly 30,000 miles. It's stretched 6inches and lowered 3inches, powercommander 3, new high performance clutch which was just installed 1000 miles ago and obviously oil was changed then too. The sprockets and chain were just replaced a few weeks ago. Tires are in good condition, the back breaks aren't the best right now but I will be changing them in the next week. $3600.

For sale is my 2006 Suzuki SV 1000S. I don't get time to ride it anymore with my job, so there's no point in keeping it around. It has a clean title, and I've owned it for about 5 years with no problems. I also have a rear seat, and the bar that goes behind the rear seat. It has a recent oil change as well. 

For any test rides, you'll have to have cash on hand. Before you can take it out, I'll want a copy of your license and insurance. If you do want to test ride it, you'll also need an M endorsement on your license.

Clean title, in hand.

The stock exhaust has been replaced with Vance Hines dual pipes on each side of the bike.  It was purchased in 2012 brand new.  It sat in the showroom floor since 2010.  I am selling because my days of the sport bike may have come to an end as I am getting more into custom bikes.  This is a great bike with low miles and unique.  It's not a ninja but is more comfortable than a ninja and does all the same things a ninja or the comparables do.

12k miles but still riding so may be a bit higher. 
It's in decent shape used, not abused. Same mechanics as a Firebolt XB9 with slightly more relaxed
rider position with taller bars and different saddle, Different lights and fairing than the firebolt.
I added a small tail bag, bar end mirrors and different grips. Mechanics are all stock and tires are OK.
The XB9 bikes were designed by Erik Buell and made by Harley Davidson with a 883cc Sportster engine 
but displacement is 883cc

Asking $2900. flexible and will consider serious offers.
Test ride is OK with full cash deposit

Let me start by saying I purchased this bike April 2015 with 4,730 miles. It currently has 8,4xx miles (less than 1,000 miles per season). Beginning of every season bike was always inspected by Monster Powersports in Wauconda and always went with full synthetic oil changes. Brakes and tires have plenty of life left. Two Brothers slip-on exhaust and aftermarket tinted windscreen. Aside from that it's bone stock. Always stored in a heated warehouse. Never stunted, never crashed.

For sale is a 2006 Kawasaki ZX-10R with 26k miles. This bike has been maintained very well and just had recent service with us including fresh oil and filter, new front and rear brake pads, and brand new Continental tires. It does have some minor cosmetic damage on the tank and right fairing but overall the bike is in great shape and is very strong mechanically. This bike has some modifications and is very powerful, the catalytic converter has been deleted and the twin mufflers under the seat have been swapped for a very nice Competition Werkes muffler that sheds a significant amount of weight and brings the center of gravity closer to the ground, which improves handling. It's been tuned for these mods by a reputable local shop and put down 161WHP on the dyno, and we have the sheet to go with the bike. This beautiful Ninja is available for viewing 7 days a week at Top Gear Powersports in Roselle, please call or stop by with any questions or inquiries.

Bike has Kenny Roberts full exhaust, integrated turn signals, rear cowling and back seat both come with it. Brake pads were replaced within the last 500 miles. I also have a icon jacket, front and rear pitbull stands, tank bag and gloves. Bike runs great and has a clean title. Reason for selling is that I don't have time to ride it anymore and hate seeing it just set. I just moved here from Tennessee which is the reason for the 423 number. Please text me as I don't get good signal at work throughout the day and i will get back to you. Please do not contact me with unsolicited ads and no i don't need help selling. Price is $5000 firm.

Great condition and low mileage.  I bought this bike this year and it has been really great for commuting.  But, need some cash, have two motorcycles and with the winter almost here, it only makes sense for me to let it go.  MUST SELL!  

There are really no cosmetic issues to speak of, other than some minor wear and tear but for the year this is in great condition.  Has aftermarket exhaust, but stock other than that.  It has never been down.  This is a 1000cc bike, so experienced riders are preferred.  No test drives without cash in hand.  

This is listed below blue book.  I am looking for a quick sale, so the right offer may just take it home, but no ridiculous low balls please.  This is a great bike for someone looking for the maneuverability of a sport bike but with the comfort of a cruiser.  

Email or text is preferred.

Well, it's time to part with my Monster.. Sad day. However, I am relocating to and cannot take it with me and not store it. So, you're given the opportunity to own this robust machine. 

A little background. 

Milage: 27173
Color: Red
Clean Title
Make: Ducati
Model: Monster S4RS
VIN: ZDM1RB5TX7B089281
996CC's
2 Owners


998 superbike motor, radial-mounted Brembo brakes, and Ohlins suspension. Brembo P34 brakes and 10-spoke Marchesini wheels. Liquid Cooled Engine. High torque, insanely fast.

The bike had been involved in a hit and run. Someone hit my car and which caused my Monster, behind it, to lean on the pole behind it, catching it by the headlight. Damaging the left light housing. Both lights are operable, however, can easily be replaced. There are absolutely no scratches or dents to the bike. A police report was filed. Other than that, it's a great bike. Truly love it.

Track Package, see all photos and description for parts, I am also open to someone who just wants the bike for the street, just make an offer. I will entertain offers but don't come to me asking my bottom dollar, that's not how bartering works.

The short:
• 18,500 miles
• 984cc 45º Harley V-Twin
• XB9R always garage kept
• maintained perfectly, always AMSOil pours.
• Previous Owner was Mark White (In the Buell community you may know him) who took care of this bike wonderfully and has done most of the work on it even while I've owned it.

The long:
• Bike has an 06 swing arm with Buell chain guard and chain conversion with a swivel chain tensioner.
• ZTL2 Front Brake
• Nissin Master cylinder
• Buell Right Side Scoop
• K&N air filter (just cleaned and re-oiled)
• Q3+ tires with lots of life left on them
• Jardine exhaust, was serviced and repacked with MX packing. Makes it slightly quieter but also causes less vibration and less wear on the rivets.
• T-Rex Case Sliders
• 5-0dro Spool Axel Sliders (little rash)
• 5-0dro CNC Drive Cover
• New Lithium Battery this season.

Track Parts
• Fiberglass one piece race tail.
• Extra sub-frame
• Extra undertail
• Carbon fiber airbox cover (with some damage, most can be fixed with a fresh coat of clear coat.)
• Front Fender
• Upper fairing and race number plate cover.
• Extra Bars
• ZTL(1) stock brake and extra levers
• Extra Nissin ZTL2 Lever
• 3 Extra Clutch Levers, one stock, one shorty, one folding (wrecked but works.)
• Heel Guards
• Extra shift assembly
• Extra Brake Pedal
• Extra seats
• Extra Windscreens, one double bubble, one smoke stock height.
• Extra swing arm chain guard.

Bike has been tracked, ridden hard, has been low sided but the bike is fine, the bars and controls took all the damage. Title is clear in Indiana. It has always been maintained and properly cared for. New Spark plugs were just put in and an oil change was recently done. I'm really just selling because I'm moving on to an 1125 for the track.

Just to start I do not need to sell, I've realized I'm just to old for this much bike. 
This is a 2003 Suzuki GSX R1000. It is a very clean bike, never been down. It does have some imperfections here and there but a very solid reliable bike. 
Some mods include:
Full Yosi exhaust
Power commander V
8" extended swing arm 
HID headlights 
Flush mount led turn signals
Mirror delete 

I have just replaced the spark plugs and rebuilt the fuel pump with a new filter.
Only thing the bike could use is a rear tire. 
Other than that it needs a good rider. Not a beginner. Bike is very quick. 
Has always had 93 octane fuel.
Oil has 800 miles on it.
Love the bike hate to see it go but the wife and I have found a Harley.

For sale is 2005 Kawasaki Ninja ZX10R that will make a nice winter project for someone.

Timing jumped and bent valves on #3 destroying the head plus put a big hole in the piston which allowed metal to get sucked all through the engine.  While it is rebuildable, it is much cheaper and easier to swap the entire motor with one off a wrecked bike.  I have an estimate of 8-12 hours labor from Adventure powersports here in Elizabethtown to complete a swap.  Engines are available on Ebay for $1250. Anyone with good mechanical skills could perform the swap and a service manual is included with bike.


Bike is currently NEATLY disassembled with all bolts being slotted where they go (by dealership) to point where you can see bent valves on #3 but all parts are there and bike is being sold complete.

Clean and clear title, never stolen, wrecked, or salvaged. Condition is ok. It has tipped once off the stand and once on its side stationary.  One of the black fairings has a crack by the bolt area (Can still secure) and the tank has a dent from where it fell on an exhaust header from another bike. The fairing piece behind the seat and in front of the "Backrest" is cracked through though the included pillion seat mostly covers it. There are a few small scratches and it is dirty, but overall its a nice bike for the year.

Has professionally installed and wired Nitrous, Full Hindle Exhaust, steering stabilizer, Power Comander, Speedo Healer, Spare windshield, fairing sliders, chains and sprockets, full throttle upshift kit, pillion seat, bar ends, and many of the OEM parts. Will include front and back racing stands for asking price

 Price will go up if I obtain engine and even more if I repair, I've just lost interest in riding this bike and would rather move onto to something else.

Please contact for more details

Great condition and low mileage.  I bought this bike this year and it has been really great for commuting.  But, need some cash, have two motorcycles and with the winter almost here, it only makes sense for me to let it go.  MUST SELL!  

There are really no cosmetic issues to speak of, other than some minor wear and tear but for the year this is in great condition.  Has aftermarket exhaust, but stock other than that.  It has never been down.  This is a 1000cc bike, so experienced riders are preferred.  No test drives without cash in hand.  

This is listed below blue book.  I am looking for a quick sale, so the right offer may just take it home, but no ridiculous low balls please.  This is a great bike for someone looking for the maneuverability of a sport bike but with the comfort of a cruiser.  

Email or text is preferred.

Well, it's time to part with my Monster.. Sad day. However, I am relocating to and cannot take it with me and not store it. So, you're given the opportunity to own this robust machine.

Color: Red

998 superbike motor, radial-mounted Brembo brakes, and Ohlins suspension. Brembo P34 brakes and 10-spoke Marchesini wheels. Liquid Cooled Engine. High torque, insanely fast.

The bike had been involved in a hit and run. Someone hit my car and which caused my Monster, behind it, to lean on the pole behind it, catching it by the headlight. Damaging the left light housing. Both lights are operable, however, can easily be replaced. There are absolutely no scratches or dents to the bike. A police report was filed. Other than that, it's a great bike. Truly love it.

Track Package, see all photos and description for parts, I am also open to someone who just wants the bike for the street, just make an offer. I will entertain offers but don't come to me asking my bottom dollar, that's not how bartering works.

The short:
• 18,500 miles
• 984cc 45º Harley V-Twin
• XB9R always garage kept
• maintained perfectly, always AMSOil pours.
• Previous Owner was Mark White (In the Buell community you may know him) who took care of this bike wonderfully and has done most of the work on it even while I've owned it.

The long:
• Bike has an 06 swing arm with Buell chain guard and chain conversion with a swivel chain tensioner.
• ZTL2 Front Brake
• Nissin Master cylinder
• Buell Right Side Scoop
• K&N air filter (just cleaned and re-oiled)
• Q3+ tires with lots of life left on them
• Jardine exhaust, was serviced and repacked with MX packing. Makes it slightly quieter but also causes less vibration and less wear on the rivets.
• T-Rex Case Sliders
• 5-0dro Spool Axel Sliders (little rash)
• 5-0dro CNC Drive Cover
• New Lithium Battery this season.

Track Parts
• Fiberglass one piece race tail.
• Extra sub-frame
• Extra undertail
• Carbon fiber airbox cover (with some damage, most can be fixed with a fresh coat of clear coat.)
• Front Fender
• Upper fairing and race number plate cover.
• Extra Bars
• ZTL(1) stock brake and extra levers
• Extra Nissin ZTL2 Lever
• 3 Extra Clutch Levers, one stock, one shorty, one folding (wrecked but works.)
• Heel Guards
• Extra shift assembly
• Extra Brake Pedal
• Extra seats
• Extra Windscreens, one double bubble, one smoke stock height.
• Extra swing arm chain guard.

Bike has been tracked, ridden hard, has been low sided but the bike is fine, the bars and controls took all the damage. Title is clear in Indiana. It has always been maintained and properly cared for. New Spark plugs were just put in and an oil change was recently done. I'm really just selling because I'm moving on to an 1125 for the track.

Just to start I do not need to sell, I've realized I'm just to old for this much bike. 
This is a 2003 Suzuki GSX R1000. It is a very clean bike, never been down. It does have some imperfections here and there but a very solid reliable bike. 
Some mods include:
Full Yosi exhaust
Power commander V
8" extended swing arm 
HID headlights 
Flush mount led turn signals
Mirror delete 

I have just replaced the spark plugs and rebuilt the fuel pump with a new filter.
Only thing the bike could use is a rear tire. 
Other than that it needs a good rider. Not a beginner. Bike is very quick. 
Has always had 93 octane fuel.
Oil has 800 miles on it.
Love the bike hate to see it go but the wife and I have found a Harley. 
Text or call for more info

• Previous Owner was Mark White (In the Buell community you may know him) who took care of this bike wonderfully and has done most of the work on it even while I've owned it.

The long:
• Bike has an 06 swing arm with Buell chain guard and chain conversion with a swivel chain tensioner.
• ZTL2 Front Brake
• Nissin Master cylinder
• Buell Right Side Scoop
• K&N air filter (just cleaned and re-oiled)
• Q3+ tires with lots of life left on them
• Jardine exhaust, was serviced and repacked with MX packing. Makes it slightly quieter but also causes less vibration and less wear on the rivets.
• T-Rex Case Sliders
• 5-0dro Spool Axel Sliders (little rash)
• 5-0dro CNC Drive Cover
• New Lithium Battery this season.

Track Parts
• Fiberglass one piece race tail.
• Extra sub-frame
• Extra undertail
• Carbon fiber airbox cover (with some damage, most can be fixed with a fresh coat of clear coat.)
• Front Fender
• Upper fairing and race number plate cover.
• Extra Bars
• ZTL(1) stock brake and extra levers
• Extra Nissin ZTL2 Lever
• 3 Extra Clutch Levers, one stock, one shorty, one folding (wrecked but works.)
• Heel Guards
• Extra shift assembly
• Extra Brake Pedal
• Extra seats
• Extra Windscreens, one double bubble, one smoke stock height.
• Extra swing arm chain guard.

Bike has been tracked, ridden hard, has been low sided but the bike is fine, the bars and controls took all the damage. Title is clear in Indiana. It has always been maintained and properly cared for. New Spark plugs were just put in and an oil change was recently done. I'm really just selling because I'm moving on to an 1125 for the track.

Just to start I do not need to sell, I've realized I'm just to old for this much bike. 
This is a 2003 Suzuki GSX R1000. It is a very clean bike, never been down. It does have some imperfections here and there but a very solid reliable bike. 
Some mods include:
Full Yosi exhaust
Power commander V
8" extended swing arm 
HID headlights 
Flush mount led turn signals
Mirror delete 

I have just replaced the spark plugs and rebuilt the fuel pump with a new filter.
Only thing the bike could use is a rear tire. 
Other than that it needs a good rider. Not a beginner. Bike is very quick. 
Has always had 93 octane fuel.
Oil has 800 miles on it.
Love the bike hate to see it go but the wife and I have found a Harley.

Great condition and low mileage.  I bought this bike this year and it has been really great for commuting.  But, need some cash, have two motorcycles and with the winter almost here, it only makes sense for me to let it go.  MUST SELL!  

There are really no cosmetic issues to speak of, other than some minor wear and tear but for the year this is in great condition.  Has aftermarket exhaust, but stock other than that.  It has never been down.  This is a 1000cc bike, so experienced riders are preferred.  No test drives without cash in hand.  

This is listed below blue book.  I am looking for a quick sale, so the right offer may just take it home, but no ridiculous low balls please.  This is a great bike for someone looking for the maneuverability of a sport bike but with the comfort of a cruiser.  

Email or text is preferred.

Well, it's time to part with my Monster.. Sad day. However, I am relocating to and cannot take it with me and not store it. So, you're given the opportunity to own this robust machine. 

A little background. 

Milage: 27173
Color: Red
Clean Title
Make: Ducati
Model: Monster S4RS
VIN: ZDM1RB5TX7B089281
996CC's
2 Owners


998 superbike motor, radial-mounted Brembo brakes, and Ohlins suspension. Brembo P34 brakes and 10-spoke Marchesini wheels. Liquid Cooled Engine. High torque, insanely fast.

The bike had been involved in a hit and run. Someone hit my car and which caused my Monster, behind it, to lean on the pole behind it, catching it by the headlight. Damaging the left light housing. Both lights are operable, however, can easily be replaced. There are absolutely no scratches or dents to the bike. A police report was filed. Other than that, it's a great bike. Truly love it.

Great condition and low mileage.  I bought this bike this year and it has been really great for commuting.  But, need some cash, have two motorcycles and with the winter almost here, it only makes sense for me to let it go.  MUST SELL!  

There are really no cosmetic issues to speak of, other than some minor wear and tear but for the year this is in great condition.  Has aftermarket exhaust, but stock other than that.  It has never been down.  This is a 1000cc bike, so experienced riders are preferred.  No test drives without cash in hand.  

This is listed below blue book.  I am looking for a quick sale, so the right offer may just take it home, but no ridiculous low balls please.  This is a great bike for someone looking for the maneuverability of a sport bike but with the comfort of a cruiser.  

Email or text is preferred.

Well, it's time to part with my Monster.. Sad day. However, I am relocating to and cannot take it with me and not store it. So, you're given the opportunity to own this robust machine. 

A little background. 

Milage: 27173
Color: Red
Clean Title
Make: Ducati
Model: Monster S4RS
VIN: ZDM1RB5TX7B089281
996CC's
2 Owners


998 superbike motor, radial-mounted Brembo brakes, and Ohlins suspension. Brembo P34 brakes and 10-spoke Marchesini wheels. Liquid Cooled Engine. High torque, insanely fast.

The bike had been involved in a hit and run. Someone hit my car and which caused my Monster, behind it, to lean on the pole behind it, catching it by the headlight. Damaging the left light housing. Both lights are operable, however, can easily be replaced. There are absolutely no scratches or dents to the bike. A police report was filed. Other than that, it's a great bike. Truly love it.

Track Package, see all photos and description for parts, I am also open to someone who just wants the bike for the street, just make an offer. I will entertain offers but don't come to me asking my bottom dollar, that's not how bartering works.

The short:
• 18,500 miles
• 984cc 45º Harley V-Twin
• XB9R always garage kept
• maintained perfectly, always AMSOil pours.
• Previous Owner was Mark White (In the Buell community you may know him) who took care of this bike wonderfully and has done most of the work on it even while I've owned it.

The long:
• Bike has an 06 swing arm with Buell chain guard and chain conversion with a swivel chain tensioner.
• ZTL2 Front Brake
• Nissin Master cylinder
• Buell Right Side Scoop
• K&N air filter (just cleaned and re-oiled)
• Q3+ tires with lots of life left on them
• Jardine exhaust, was serviced and repacked with MX packing. Makes it slightly quieter but also causes less vibration and less wear on the rivets.
• T-Rex Case Sliders
• 5-0dro Spool Axel Sliders (little rash)
• 5-0dro CNC Drive Cover
• New Lithium Battery this season.

Track Parts
• Fiberglass one piece race tail.
• Extra sub-frame
• Extra undertail
• Carbon fiber airbox cover (with some damage, most can be fixed with a fresh coat of clear coat.)
• Front Fender
• Upper fairing and race number plate cover.
• Extra Bars
• ZTL(1) stock brake and extra levers
• Extra Nissin ZTL2 Lever
• 3 Extra Clutch Levers, one stock, one shorty, one folding (wrecked but works.)
• Heel Guards
• Extra shift assembly
• Extra Brake Pedal
• Extra seats
• Extra Windscreens, one double bubble, one smoke stock height.
• Extra swing arm chain guard.

Bike has been tracked, ridden hard, has been low sided but the bike is fine, the bars and controls took all the damage. Title is clear in Indiana. It has always been maintained and properly cared for. New Spark plugs were just put in and an oil change was recently done. I'm really just selling because I'm moving on to an 1125 for the track.

Just to start I do not need to sell, I've realized I'm just to old for this much bike. 
This is a 2003 Suzuki GSX R1000. It is a very clean bike, never been down. It does have some imperfections here and there but a very solid reliable bike. 
Some mods include:
Full Yosi exhaust
Power commander V
8" extended swing arm 
HID headlights 
Flush mount led turn signals
Mirror delete 

I have just replaced the spark plugs and rebuilt the fuel pump with a new filter.
Only thing the bike could use is a rear tire. 
Other than that it needs a good rider. Not a beginner. Bike is very quick. 
Has always had 93 octane fuel.
Oil has 800 miles on it.
Love the bike hate to see it go but the wife and I have found a Harley.

I have a 02 VTR 1000 Superhawk that I am selling. I was in a motorcycle accident May 20th and I am looking to sell it now. I bought it from a dealer for $4000 and it has 18,000 miles. KBB has it priced at 3,030 at excellent condition(which it was lol). Now it needs a crankcase cover($200), right driver/passenger foot pegs($25), and a brake pedal($72), and tires(they rear one is flat $100). Has an aftermarket exhaust. Total cost of parts is $600(for both tires). Text or call is fine. Prefer text @ 937-SeVen65-43sixtwo.

Great condition and low mileage.  I bought this bike this year and it has been really great for commuting.  But, need some cash, have two motorcycles and with the winter almost here, it only makes sense for me to let it go.  MUST SELL!  

There are really no cosmetic issues to speak of, other than some minor wear and tear but for the year this is in great condition.  Has aftermarket exhaust, but stock other than that.  It has never been down.  This is a 1000cc bike, so experienced riders are preferred.  No test drives without cash in hand.  

This is listed below blue book.  I am looking for a quick sale, so the right offer may just take it home, but no ridiculous low balls please.  This is a great bike for someone looking for the maneuverability of a sport bike but with the comfort of a cruiser.  

Email or text is preferred.

Well, it's time to part with my Monster.. Sad day. However, I am relocating to and cannot take it with me and not store it. So, you're given the opportunity to own this robust machine. 

A little background. 

Milage: 27173
Color: Red
Clean Title
Make: Ducati
Model: Monster S4RS
VIN: ZDM1RB5TX7B089281
996CC's
2 Owners


998 superbike motor, radial-mounted Brembo brakes, and Ohlins suspension. Brembo P34 brakes and 10-spoke Marchesini wheels. Liquid Cooled Engine. High torque, insanely fast.

The bike had been involved in a hit and run. Someone hit my car and which caused my Monster, behind it, to lean on the pole behind it, catching it by the headlight. Damaging the left light housing. Both lights are operable, however, can easily be replaced. There are absolutely no scratches or dents to the bike. A police report was filed. Other than that, it's a great bike. Truly love it.

Track Package, see all photos and description for parts, I am also open to someone who just wants the bike for the street, just make an offer. I will entertain offers but don't come to me asking my bottom dollar, that's not how bartering works.

The short:
• 18,500 miles
• 984cc 45º Harley V-Twin
• XB9R always garage kept
• maintained perfectly, always AMSOil pours.
• Previous Owner was Mark White (In the Buell community you may know him) who took care of this bike wonderfully and has done most of the work on it even while I've owned it.

The long:
• Bike has an 06 swing arm with Buell chain guard and chain conversion with a swivel chain tensioner.
• ZTL2 Front Brake
• Nissin Master cylinder
• Buell Right Side Scoop
• K&N air filter (just cleaned and re-oiled)
• Q3+ tires with lots of life left on them
• Jardine exhaust, was serviced and repacked with MX packing. Makes it slightly quieter but also causes less vibration and less wear on the rivets.
• T-Rex Case Sliders
• 5-0dro Spool Axel Sliders (little rash)
• 5-0dro CNC Drive Cover
• New Lithium Battery this season.

Track Parts
• Fiberglass one piece race tail.
• Extra sub-frame
• Extra undertail
• Carbon fiber airbox cover (with some damage, most can be fixed with a fresh coat of clear coat.)
• Front Fender
• Upper fairing and race number plate cover.
• Extra Bars
• ZTL(1) stock brake and extra levers
• Extra Nissin ZTL2 Lever
• 3 Extra Clutch Levers, one stock, one shorty, one folding (wrecked but works.)
• Heel Guards
• Extra shift assembly
• Extra Brake Pedal
• Extra seats
• Extra Windscreens, one double bubble, one smoke stock height.
• Extra swing arm chain guard.

Bike has been tracked, ridden hard, has been low sided but the bike is fine, the bars and controls took all the damage. Title is clear in Indiana. It has always been maintained and properly cared for. New Spark plugs were just put in and an oil change was recently done. I'm really just selling because I'm moving on to an 1125 for the track.

Just to start I do not need to sell, I've realized I'm just to old for this much bike. 
This is a 2003 Suzuki GSX R1000. It is a very clean bike, never been down. It does have some imperfections here and there but a very solid reliable bike. 
Some mods include:
Full Yosi exhaust
Power commander V
8" extended swing arm 
HID headlights 
Flush mount led turn signals
Mirror delete 

I have just replaced the spark plugs and rebuilt the fuel pump with a new filter.
Only thing the bike could use is a rear tire. 
Other than that it needs a good rider. Not a beginner. Bike is very quick. 
Has always had 93 octane fuel.
Oil has 800 miles on it.
Love the bike hate to see it go but the wife and I have found a Harley.

For sale is a 2010 Kawasaki Z1000.  It is a naked sport bike.  It has a 1000cc 4 cylinder motor.  It has 1800 miles.  It has a power commander installed.  The stock exhaust has been replaced with Vance Hines dual pipes on each side of the bike.  It was purchased in 2012 brand new.  It sat in the showroom floor since 2010.  I am selling because my days of the sport bike may have come to an end as I am getting more into custom bikes.  This is a great bike with low miles and unique.  It's not a ninja but is more comfortable than a ninja and does all the same things a ninja or the comparables do.

12k miles but still riding so may be a bit higher. 
It's in decent shape used, not abused. Same mechanics as a Firebolt XB9 with slightly more relaxed
rider position with taller bars and different saddle, Different lights and fairing than the firebolt.
I added a small tail bag, bar end mirrors and different grips. Mechanics are all stock and tires are OK.
The XB9 bikes were designed by Erik Buell and made by Harley Davidson with a 883cc Sportster engine 
but displacement is 883cc

Asking $2900. flexible and will consider serious offers.
Test ride is OK with full cash deposit

Beginning of every season bike was always inspected by Monster Powersports in Wauconda and always went with full synthetic oil changes. Brakes and tires have plenty of life left.

For sale is a 2006 Kawasaki ZX-10R with 26k miles. This bike has been maintained very well and just had recent service with us including fresh oil and filter, new front and rear brake pads, and brand new Continental tires. It does have some minor cosmetic damage on the tank and right fairing but overall the bike is in great shape and is very strong mechanically. This bike has some modifications and is very powerful, the catalytic converter has been deleted and the twin mufflers under the seat have been swapped for a very nice Competition Werkes muffler that sheds a significant amount of weight and brings the center of gravity closer to the ground, which improves handling. It's been tuned for these mods by a reputable local shop and put down 161WHP on the dyno, and we have the sheet to go with the bike. This beautiful Ninja is available for viewing 7 days a week at Top Gear Powersports in Roselle, please call or stop by with any questions or inquiries.

I have an 05 R1 i'm looking to sell. I have a loan on the bike so would have to go to the bank when buying to get the title. The bike has roughly 30,000 miles. It's stretched 6inches and lowered 3inches, powercommander 3, new high performance clutch which was just installed 1000 miles ago and obviously oil was changed then too. The sprockets and chain were just replaced a few weeks ago. Tires are in good condition, the back breaks aren't the best right now but I will be changing them in the next week. $3600. If you have any questions contact me via text at  show contact info

Great condition and low mileage.  I bought this bike this year and it has been really great for commuting.  But, need some cash, have two motorcycles and with the winter almost here, it only makes sense for me to let it go.  MUST SELL!  

There are really no cosmetic issues to speak of, other than some minor wear and tear but for the year this is in great condition.  Has aftermarket exhaust, but stock other than that.  It has never been down.  This is a 1000cc bike, so experienced riders are preferred.  No test drives without cash in hand.  

This is listed below blue book.  I am looking for a quick sale, so the right offer may just take it home, but no ridiculous low balls please.  This is a great bike for someone looking for the maneuverability of a sport bike but with the comfort of a cruiser.  

Email or text is preferred.

Well, it's time to part with my Monster.. Sad day. However, I am relocating to and cannot take it with me and not store it. So, you're given the opportunity to own this robust machine. 

A little background. 

Milage: 27173
Color: Red
Clean Title
Make: Ducati
Model: Monster S4RS
VIN: ZDM1RB5TX7B089281
996CC's
2 Owners


998 superbike motor, radial-mounted Brembo brakes, and Ohlins suspension. Brembo P34 brakes and 10-spoke Marchesini wheels. Liquid Cooled Engine. High torque, insanely fast.

The bike had been involved in a hit and run. Someone hit my car and which caused my Monster, behind it, to lean on the pole behind it, catching it by the headlight. Damaging the left light housing. Both lights are operable, however, can easily be replaced. There are absolutely no scratches or dents to the bike. A police report was filed. Other than that, it's a great bike. Truly love it.

Looks Great, Runs Great, Sounds Amazing

Dual exhaust with V Twin motor... by far my favorite sport bike

Open to trades and offers... if I dont respond I'm probably not interested.

Dont really need to sell... but I'm going back to a cruiser next year. I'm going to kill myself if I keep riding this thing.

Track Package, see all photos and description for parts, I am also open to someone who just wants the bike for the street, just make an offer. I will entertain offers but don't come to me asking my bottom dollar, that's not how bartering works.

The short:
• 18,500 miles
• 984cc 45º Harley V-Twin
• XB9R always garage kept
• maintained perfectly, always AMSOil pours.
• Previous Owner was Mark White (In the Buell community you may know him) who took care of this bike wonderfully and has done most of the work on it even while I've owned it.

The long:
• Bike has an 06 swing arm with Buell chain guard and chain conversion with a swivel chain tensioner.
• ZTL2 Front Brake
• Nissin Master cylinder
• Buell Right Side Scoop
• K&N air filter (just cleaned and re-oiled)
• Q3+ tires with lots of life left on them
• Jardine exhaust, was serviced and repacked with MX packing. Makes it slightly quieter but also causes less vibration and less wear on the rivets.
• T-Rex Case Sliders
• 5-0dro Spool Axel Sliders (little rash)
• 5-0dro CNC Drive Cover
• New Lithium Battery this season.

Track Parts
• Fiberglass one piece race tail.
• Extra sub-frame
• Extra undertail
• Carbon fiber airbox cover (with some damage, most can be fixed with a fresh coat of clear coat.)
• Front Fender
• Upper fairing and race number plate cover.
• Extra Bars
• ZTL(1) stock brake and extra levers
• Extra Nissin ZTL2 Lever
• 3 Extra Clutch Levers, one stock, one shorty, one folding (wrecked but works.)
• Heel Guards
• Extra shift assembly
• Extra Brake Pedal
• Extra seats
• Extra Windscreens, one double bubble, one smoke stock height.
• Extra swing arm chain guard.

Bike has been tracked, ridden hard, has been low sided but the bike is fine, the bars and controls took all the damage. Title is clear in Indiana. It has always been maintained and properly cared for. New Spark plugs were just put in and an oil change was recently done. I'm really just selling because I'm moving on to an 1125 for the track.

Just to start I do not need to sell, I've realized I'm just to old for this much bike. 
This is a 2003 Suzuki GSX R1000. It is a very clean bike, never been down. It does have some imperfections here and there but a very solid reliable bike. 
Some mods include:
Full Yosi exhaust
Power commander V
8" extended swing arm 
HID headlights 
Flush mount led turn signals
Mirror delete 

I have just replaced the spark plugs and rebuilt the fuel pump with a new filter.
Only thing the bike could use is a rear tire. 
Other than that it needs a good rider. Not a beginner. Bike is very quick. 
Has always had 93 octane fuel.
Oil has 800 miles on it.
Love the bike hate to see it go but the wife and I have found a Harley. 
Text or call for more info

I've owned this bike for a little bit over two years and I love it! Runs good, shifts good, and it's crazy fast! It does have many modifications, so I'll do my best to name them all:

Two Brother Racing Black Series exhaust($850 exhaust system!)
Dynojet power commander III with custom tune
905 Racing race rails
GPR 4 steering stabilizer
ASV unbreakable shorty levers(over $200 alone!)
Sunstar front and rear sprockets

Very new Bridgestone battleax tires, front and rear
10000k HIDs, high and low beams
Blue led teardrop lights
Progrip grips
Puig black bubble windshield 
Mirror deletes
Fender eliminator and plate relocate
Professionally powder coated rear sets
Tinted turn signals and tail light

I have a -2 front sprocket and stock mirrors i can include in the sale as well. I just had the GPR stabilizer rebuilt over winter and the bike had a fresh oil change around 100 miles ago.

Bike isn't perfect. There's a few small scratches in the plastics. The only thing I think it will need before too long is new front rotors. 

I get compliments on it all the time about how beautiful the color is and how mean it sounds.

Only reason I am wanting to sell because I am hoping to buy something a little more comfortable. 

$4,500 takes it. I'll consider trades but no junk or under value. No test rides unless you have cash and a motorcycle license. I prefer text messages so only call me if you have to. Thanks for looking and let me know of you have any questions!

ASV unbreakable shorty levers(over $200 alone!)
Sunstar front and rear sprockets
DID 525 gold chain
Very new Bridgestone battleax tires, front and rear
10000k HIDs, high and low beams
Blue led teardrop lights
Progrip grips
Puig black bubble windshield 
Mirror deletes
Fender eliminator and plate relocate
Professionally powder coated rear sets
Tinted turn signals and tail light

I have a -2 front sprocket and stock mirrors i can include in the sale as well. I just had the GPR stabilizer rebuilt over winter and the bike had a fresh oil change around 100 miles ago.

Bike isn't perfect. There's a few small scratches in the plastics. The only thing I think it will need before too long is new front rotors. 

I get compliments on it all the time about how beautiful the color is and how mean it sounds.

Only reason I am wanting to sell because I am hoping to buy something a little more comfortable. 

$4,500 takes it. I'll consider trades but no junk or under value. No test rides unless you have cash and a motorcycle license. I prefer text messages so only call me if you have to. Thanks for looking and let me know of you have any questions!

2007 Kawasaki Ninja ZX10r
35,000 miles
1000cc

I've owned this bike for a little bit over two years and I love it! Runs good, shifts good, and it's crazy fast! It does have many modifications, so I'll do my best to name them all:

Two Brother Racing Black Series exhaust($850 exhaust system!)
Dynojet power commander III with custom tune
905 Racing race rails
GPR 4 steering stabilizer
ASV unbreakable shorty levers(over $200 alone!)
Sunstar front and rear sprockets
DID 525 gold chain
Very new Bridgestone battleax tires, front and rear
10000k HIDs, high and low beams
Blue led teardrop lights
Progrip grips
Puig black bubble windshield 
Mirror deletes
Fender eliminator and plate relocate
Professionally powder coated rear sets
Tinted turn signals and tail light

I have a -2 front sprocket and stock mirrors i can include in the sale as well. I just had the GPR stabilizer rebuilt over winter and the bike had a fresh oil change around 100 miles ago.

Bike isn't perfect. There's a few small scratches in the plastics. The only thing I think it will need before too long is new front rotors. 

I get compliments on it all the time about how beautiful the color is and how mean it sounds.

Only reason I am wanting to sell because I am hoping to buy something a little more comfortable. 

$4,500 takes it. I'll consider trades but no junk or under value. No test rides unless you have cash and a motorcycle license. I prefer text messages so only call me if you have to. Thanks for looking and let me know of you have any questions!

Excellent bike, runs like new. Two very mature owners. The previous owner was also in his 60's. I've decided to go with a maxi-scooter since it's easier on my hands. This bike has never been abused and has always been garaged. Extremely fast with comfortable ergos. Definitely not a bike to learn on. Coolant and brake fluid were flushed last summer. New NGK iridium spark plugs, air filter, and Dunlop Roadsmart II's at the same time. Yoshi exhaust with stage I jetting. Zero Gravity windscreen gives better wind protection than stock and looks better, too. Wired for a battery tender. Will also include the stock exhaust in new condition. Serious inquiries only, please. Call or text  show contact info
. If the ad is up, it's still for sale.

Excellent bike, runs like new. Two very mature owners. The previous owner was also in his 60's. I've decided to go with a maxi-scooter since it's easier on my hands. This bike has never been abused and has always been garaged. Extremely fast with comfortable ergos. Definitely not a bike to learn on. Coolant and brake fluid were flushed last summer. New NGK iridium spark plugs, air filter, and Dunlop Roadsmart II's at the same time. Yoshi exhaust with stage I jetting. Zero Gravity windscreen gives better wind protection than stock and looks better, too. Wired for a battery tender. Will also include the stock exhaust in new condition. Serious inquiries only, please. Call or text  show contact info
. If the ad is up, it's still for sale.

2005 Kawasaki Concours only 6K miles! $2500. PO passed away and his wife sold to me. Carbs rebuilt by Shoodabeen Engineering in FL and also had overflow kits and new jets and 2 Minute Mod Jet Kit ($475). New plugs and K&N filter installed. New battery installed last year. I put on Murph's Knee Savers lowered footpegs ($140). I also installed Murph's block-off plates on valve covers($40). No more EGR! Nice trunk w/key also have new key for the sidebags. Good tires w/fresh oil and I will also include 2 K&N oil filters. I also have the Murph's manual petcock kit that I haven't installed yet that I'll include. I also put on a newer windshield. Bike has heated grips also-not working I'm not an electrical dude so I didn't mess with it, likely a fuse or someone pulled the fuse.

Here is a list of spare parts I'll include with the bike:

A spare OEM seat in perfect shape.
A spare J-Box fuse box
A spare Ignitor box
A complete headlight assembly w/bulb in it.
I have the Jbox and ignitor box here in OK, I'll have to ship the head light and seat from GA at my expense.

I have developed a hip problem and can no longer ride the bike in comfort even with the new pegs so I'm moving on. As the pics show, the left mirror is broken off when the bike fell over on soft ground. Still have the old one. A new one from Murph's is $120, maybe we can work something out on that, but as you can see with all the extras and low miles someone is getting a very good deal.

Oh one last thing the PO lost some of the screws from the fairing, just being upfront about it. Good luck but if you don't have the money please don't waste my time and yours. Please call 9 one 8-4 five 8-608 eight. No lowballers, scammers or BS please. Everyone else, thanks for looking!

Up for sale is a 2004 Yamaha YZF R1. This color was only produced for 2004 and is very rare. There are a couple modifications including a Power Commander V, Velocity Stacks, and a Race Exhaust modifications with a gutted Cat, Shorty Levers. The Bike runs and sounds fantastic. Transmission shifts smooth and the clutch grabs great. The bike is currently right around 12K Miles. At 10K Miles, the original Motor spun a rod bearing, was rebuilt, and then the timing chain popped causing it drop a valve. So a new motor was purchased. I was told it had 5K miles on the motor. It was put in and has been running like a top ever since. The bike will come with the other motor for donor parts it ever needs it. Please call or text me with any questions. I do not have to sell the bike, but I just don't ride it enough. No Crazy Low Offers, I will not even reply to them. $4100 OBO. Rode this bike yesterday 9/9/18 and it is running strong. Grab this thing up while the weather is as good as it is. 7K MILE ON MOTOR! Not looking for Trades at the moment and once again, I don't need to sell it, just don't ride it enough.

Still have tread. I will throw in chain cleaner if you are wanting it. No low ball offers. I DO NOT need to sell this motorcycle. Although I'd like to. I'm not doing trades unless you have a Scar 17 or a fucking Barrett .50 
I'm asking $7,000 firm
I know that KBB is around 7,200 or more.

Excellent bike, runs like new. Two very mature owners. The previous owner was also in his 60's. I've decided to go with a maxi-scooter since it's easier on my hands. This bike has never been abused and has always been garaged. Extremely fast with comfortable ergos. Definitely not a bike to learn on. Coolant and brake fluid were flushed last summer. New NGK iridium spark plugs, air filter, and Dunlop Roadsmart II's at the same time. Yoshi exhaust with stage I jetting. Zero Gravity windscreen gives better wind protection than stock and looks better, too. Wired for a battery tender. Will also include the stock exhaust in new condition. Serious inquiries only, please. Call or text  show contact info

2005 Kawasaki Concours only 6K miles! $2500. PO passed away and his wife sold to me. Carbs rebuilt by Shoodabeen Engineering in FL and also had overflow kits and new jets and 2 Minute Mod Jet Kit ($475). New plugs and K&N filter installed. New battery installed last year. I put on Murph's Knee Savers lowered footpegs ($140). I also installed Murph's block-off plates on valve covers($40). No more EGR! Nice trunk w/key also have new key for the sidebags. Good tires w/fresh oil and I will also include 2 K&N oil filters. I also have the Murph's manual petcock kit that I haven't installed yet that I'll include. I also put on a newer windshield. Bike has heated grips also-not working I'm not an electrical dude so I didn't mess with it, likely a fuse or someone pulled the fuse.

Here is a list of spare parts I'll include with the bike:

A spare OEM seat in perfect shape.
A spare J-Box fuse box
A spare Ignitor box
A complete headlight assembly w/bulb in it.
I have the Jbox and ignitor box here in OK, I'll have to ship the head light and seat from GA at my expense.

I have developed a hip problem and can no longer ride the bike in comfort even with the new pegs so I'm moving on. As the pics show, the left mirror is broken off when the bike fell over on soft ground. Still have the old one. A new one from Murph's is $120, maybe we can work something out on that, but as you can see with all the extras and low miles someone is getting a very good deal.

Oh one last thing the PO lost some of the screws from the fairing, just being upfront about it. Good luck but if you don't have the money please don't waste my time and yours. Please call 9 one 8-4 five 8-608 eight. No lowballers, scammers or BS please. Everyone else, thanks for looking!

I am will to accept Bitcoin as payment 

The Bike has many upgrades:
Corbin Gel seat ($450) http://www.corbin.com/

This is a great bike! I purchased the bike from a friend in 2009, currently showing 48k on the odometer, the bike only had 16k miles when purchased so most of the miles I have put on myself. Regular oil changes, last one was in April 2018 with very few miles ridden since then. Garage kept, never laid down but there are a few scuff's and scratches (see pictures) but bike is in great working order. The only reason i'm looking to sell is i'd like to upgrade to an R1.

List of upgrades:
- Ivan's Jet Kit (professionally installed by PJ of PJ's parts, https://www.facebook.com/PJsParts/)
- Yoshimura aftermarket pipe (with air box mod)
- Like new set of tires (less than 500 miles)
- Like new front and rear sprockets + chain (less than 500 miles)
- Integrated tail light

-Speedohealer with top-speed recall button

For sale is 2005 Kawasaki Ninja ZX10R that will make a nice winter project for someone.

Timing jumped and bent valves on #3 destroying the head plus put a big hole in the piston which allowed metal to get sucked all through the engine.  While it is rebuildable, it is much cheaper and easier to swap the entire motor with one off a wrecked bike.  I have an estimate of 8-12 hours labor from Adventure powersports here in Elizabethtown to complete a swap.  Engines are available on Ebay for $1250. Anyone with good mechanical skills could perform the swap and a service manual is included with bike.


Bike is currently NEATLY disassembled with all bolts being slotted where they go (by dealership) to point where you can see bent valves on #3 but all parts are there and bike is being sold complete.

Clean and clear title, never stolen, wrecked, or salvaged. Condition is ok. It has tipped once off the stand and once on its side stationary.  One of the black fairings has a crack by the bolt area (Can still secure) and the tank has a dent from where it fell on an exhaust header from another bike. The fairing piece behind the seat and in front of the "Backrest" is cracked through though the included pillion seat mostly covers it. There are a few small scratches and it is dirty, but overall its a nice bike for the year.

Has professionally installed and wired Nitrous, Full Hindle Exhaust, steering stabilizer, Power Comander, Speedo Healer, Spare windshield, fairing sliders, chains and sprockets, full throttle upshift kit, pillion seat, bar ends, and many of the OEM parts. Will include front and back racing stands for asking price

 Price will go up if I obtain engine and even more if I repair, I've just lost interest in riding this bike and would rather move onto to something else.

Please contact for more details

Only seen the rain once since I've had it.

Specs:

•Michelin pilot power 3's - roughly 150 miles on them 
•D&D exhaust - sounds great 
•CRG RC2 levers 
•aftermarket motion pro throttle
•LightTech mirror block offs
•HID headlight (needs a high beam)
•Green underglow lights 
•Green glow outline around headlights

I am not in any hurry to sell this bike. This bike has been nothing but great to me but I'm looking to get a different kind of bike. Only trades considered will be a stunt bike.No test rides without cash in hand. Feel free to shoot me a text ( I don't usually answer random number calls) 5!3 544 789!

For sale is 2005 Kawasaki Ninja ZX10R that will make a nice winter project for someone.

Timing jumped and bent valves on #3 destroying the head plus put a big hole in the piston which allowed metal to get sucked all through the engine.  While it is rebuildable, it is much cheaper and easier to swap the entire motor with one off a wrecked bike.  I have an estimate of 8-12 hours labor from Adventure powersports here in Elizabethtown to complete a swap.  Engines are available on Ebay for $1250. Anyone with good mechanical skills could perform the swap and a service manual is included with bike.


Bike is currently NEATLY disassembled with all bolts being slotted where they go (by dealership) to point where you can see bent valves on #3 but all parts are there and bike is being sold complete.

Clean and clear title, never stolen, wrecked, or salvaged. Condition is ok. It has tipped once off the stand and once on its side stationary.  One of the black fairings has a crack by the bolt area (Can still secure) and the tank has a dent from where it fell on an exhaust header from another bike. The fairing piece behind the seat and in front of the "Backrest" is cracked through though the included pillion seat mostly covers it. There are a few small scratches and it is dirty, but overall its a nice bike for the year.

Has professionally installed and wired Nitrous, Full Hindle Exhaust, steering stabilizer, Power Comander, Speedo Healer, Spare windshield, fairing sliders, chains and sprockets, full throttle upshift kit, pillion seat, bar ends, and many of the OEM parts. Will include front and back racing stands for asking price

 Price will go up if I obtain engine and even more if I repair, I've just lost interest in riding this bike and would rather move onto to something else.

Please contact for more details

This is a great bike! I purchased the bike from a friend in 2009, currently showing 48k on the odometer, the bike only had 16k miles when purchased so most of the miles I have put on myself. Regular oil changes, last one was in April 2018 with very few miles ridden since then. Garage kept, never laid down but there are a few scuff's and scratches (see pictures) but bike is in great working order. The only reason i'm looking to sell is i'd like to upgrade to an R1.

List of upgrades:
- Ivan's Jet Kit (professionally installed by PJ of PJ's parts, https://www.facebook.com/PJsParts/)
- Yoshimura aftermarket pipe (with air box mod)
- Like new set of tires (less than 500 miles)
- Like new front and rear sprockets + chain (less than 500 miles)
- Integrated tail light

For sale is a 2008 cbr1000r. I am the 3rd owner. Bike has been laid down at a very low speed(don't know exact speed neither drop was me) and tipped over in a driveway(see pictures). Bike is mechanically sound and extremely fast. Very fun Bike currently has 18xx x miles and will go up as I ride almost every day. Bike has always been well maintained and kept inside. Only seen the rain once since I've had it.

Specs:

•Michelin pilot power 3's - roughly 150 miles on them 
•D&D exhaust - sounds great 
•CRG RC2 levers 
•aftermarket motion pro throttle
•LightTech mirror block offs
•HID headlight (needs a high beam)
•Green underglow lights 
•Green glow outline around headlights
•aftermarket seat cowel

Bike will come with rear seat, original mirrors(directionals), aftermarket bar end mirrors. 

I am not in any hurry to sell this bike. This bike has been nothing but great to me but I'm looking to get a different kind of bike. Only trades considered will be a stunt bike.No test rides without cash in hand. Feel free to shoot me a text ( I don't usually answer random number calls) 5!3 544 789!

For sale is 2005 Kawasaki Ninja ZX10R that will make a nice winter project for someone.

Timing jumped and bent valves on #3 destroying the head plus put a big hole in the piston which allowed metal to get sucked all through the engine.  While it is rebuildable, it is much cheaper and easier to swap the entire motor with one off a wrecked bike.  I have an estimate of 8-12 hours labor from Adventure powersports here in Elizabethtown to complete a swap.  Engines are available on Ebay for $1250. Anyone with good mechanical skills could perform the swap and a service manual is included with bike.


Bike is currently NEATLY disassembled with all bolts being slotted where they go (by dealership) to point where you can see bent valves on #3 but all parts are there and bike is being sold complete.

Clean and clear title, never stolen, wrecked, or salvaged. Condition is ok. It has tipped once off the stand and once on its side stationary.  One of the black fairings has a crack by the bolt area (Can still secure) and the tank has a dent from where it fell on an exhaust header from another bike. The fairing piece behind the seat and in front of the "Backrest" is cracked through though the included pillion seat mostly covers it. There are a few small scratches and it is dirty, but overall its a nice bike for the year.

Has professionally installed and wired Nitrous, Full Hindle Exhaust, steering stabilizer, Power Comander, Speedo Healer, Spare windshield, fairing sliders, chains and sprockets, full throttle upshift kit, pillion seat, bar ends, and many of the OEM parts. Will include front and back racing stands for asking price

 Price will go up if I obtain engine and even more if I repair, I've just lost interest in riding this bike and would rather move onto to something else.

Please contact for more details

I'm selling due to not using it as much as i thought i would and its not the best for 2 up riding.

Bike's in great shape. Fires right up, no smoke, no mechanical issues. I'm the second owner, had it since 2010. Maintenance has been kept up. It was laid down once hence the aftermarket body but no structural damage occurred. It has K&N air filter, Two Brothers bolt-ons, and PCIII. Front brakes have been upgraded to Nissin calipers from a Zx14, braided lines, and a Brembo front caliper. Also has a white LED light kit. Clean title in hand. Located in Waveland. I'm not interested in trades.

I purchased the bike nearby a few years ago when it had a few thousand miles on it.  At the time, I was riding my R6 most days but once I got used to the more upright riding position on the FZ1 I was sold on the sport touring capabilities. I've really enjoyed turning this fairly naked street bike into a decent touring machine but with the addition of a new bike to the stable this ride needs a new home.  Addons include two powerlet/DC outlets, ram mount, GiVi V35 side saddlebags with quick disconnect frames and removable zippered liners, plus two rear sprocket, Barkbuster storm handguards, Zero Gravity windscreen and Sargent rider seat.  Rolling on new Michelin Pilot Road 4 upsized 190/55/17 rear and fairly new standard sized 120/70/17 - awesome tires and can't wait until I can make an excuse to get them on the new bike. I can get around 180 mies on a tank with this setup which is about 38 MPG.  The engine has more than enough power to roll past a pack of creepers and doorslammers on backroads or the famous Dragon.  

The new owner will be happy with the cleanliness, mechanical operation and upkeep of the bike - title in hand, no trades, no BS, no hassle. *NOT MY FIRST RODEO*

Bike is in great shape for the year. My father bought this brand new in 05 and put about 40k miles on it. It became too much bike for him so he passed it along to me in 2014. The bike now has 42K miles and it's just sitting most of the time. I don't have time to ride and completely lost interest when my father stopped riding. The tires are practically new with only about 300 miles on them. It starts right up and runs great. I have some oil filters, manual, tank bag, tank bra, and whatever else I can find that will be passed along to the new owner. I'm looking for a quick clean sale so I don't have to store it for the winter. No trades.

2006 FZ1000 with about 19,000 miles on it. This bike has always been in a heated garage in the offseason and meticulously taken care of its whole life. It has an aftermarket Mivv Suono exhaust which has a really nice deep sound. The only other upgrades it has are a fender eliminator kit, adjustable clutch and brake levers, and a new Dunlop Q3 front tire. Rear tire still has plenty of tread on it. I love this bike and don't really want to sell but its time for a cruiser. Serious inquiries only. Asking price is $3800. Call or text

Has a dent near the gas can and some pretty minor scrapes and dings.

This bike is a conversation starter to say the least! I took this bike to Motorcycle Week at Weirs Beach and it was the only one of its kind there!

----------------------------------------------------

PROS: New Diablo Rosso tires and accent underglow with numerous light settings (it strobes to music)! It sounds like a Harley because its a Buell! Starts, runs and owns the corners!

CONS: Hiccup on start up, one fork seal leaking, and small oil leak from a bolt on the engine. 

----------------------------------------------------

I would love to keep it but I'm converting a campervan and need money to travel. Need gone ASAP. **CASH ONLY** Season ending price: $3300 OBRO. Pick up required, may be able to transport for local buyers.

The bad...
There are a few rips in the seats.
This bike runs with two headlights on at the same time.  One of them is out and needs to be replaced.  It is an LED kit I had to purchase for both headlights.  One side still works fine and hasn't effected visibility at all which is why I haven't bothered with it.
The blinkers hyperflash.  Did not want to install the relays.  I have the relays but I like the speed of the flashers.
The paint on the rear wheel looks like some of the chain lube must've baked onto it.  Doesn't look horrible, but bothers me.

Just put $1000 into it.

 so anyways this one he does not use so it has to go. not really much to say about the bike. starts and runs good, shifts as it should it is a 2002 sport touring motorcycle so its been around, has a few scratches here and there, still looks very good. has good tires, perfect to enjoy some of the best riding Vermont and new Hampshire have to offer. this is a fall price and will be higher in the spring. like I said its hard to store 8 motorcycles all winter.
 bike has 39000 miles on it, very low mileage for its age. well cared for.

1000 CC V twin Aprilia Tuono.  Extremely rare and powerful motorcycle with more than enough low end torque and horsepower.  Has a more upright seating position compared to most sport bikes that makes it more comfortable for longer rides, but aggressive and powerful enough to get into the twisties and lift the front wheel in just about any gear if you desire.  All stock with the exception of upgraded Leo Vince exhaust system, cleaner license plate holder, clear turn signal lenses and frame sliders.  Adult owned, garage kept and never laid down.  New rear tire.  Low miles.  Passenger seat and seat cowl included.  Great bike, meticulously maintained, no mechanical issues.  Cash only, no trades.  Test rides with cash in hand.  I'll include front and rear wheel stands for maintenance and an armored leather jacked if interested.  Located in the Mount Vernon area of Alexandria.

Selling my 2005 Kawaski Concours ZG1000. Bike is in impeccable condition. You will have to see it!
23000 miles, always garaged, never down, zero damage, no scratches, no rust! I have owned the bike since 2012 when I purchased it from it's original owner. Purchased as a backup bike she just does not get much use anymore since I don't ride as much as I used to..
Here are some of the things that I have done since I have owned her:
I removed the carbs and had them redone by: https://sites.google.com/site/shoodabenengineering/home
The carbs were cleaned, rejetted, overflow protection installed and sinked. I also purchased their new cams that were installed by Zebra Racing in " Marsh", VA. The bike was dino tuned for maximum efficiency. I am not a speed racer but I enjoy a well running
machine. ( you can read about the tuning philosophy on the shoodabenengineering website (link above).
Since I am 5' 11" with a 34"inseam I made a few further adjustments. 
I installed handlebar risers and lowering pegs as well as handlebar weights. All of that allows the rider to decompress and sit more upright. The bar weights reduce vibration. The bike currently has the short windshield installed (pictured). I do have the original touring windshield as well.
The tires are in great shape, maybe 1500 miles on them.. No maintenance needed, just get on it and ride.
 I hate to see her go but would be happy to see her on the road more often. Will entertain reasonable offers.

I'm selling a 2003 rsv mille. This is a very strong Italian super sport bike. The bike starts and runs great. Shifts smooth every gear. It's a 1000cc, liquid cooled, Vtwin with a 6 speed manual trans. The tires have good life left in them. 23,218 on the odometer. Normal wear and tear on the body. The only thing I see wrong is leaking fork seals. 2003 is the first one only year of the big valve engine in this model motorcycle. It makes the most hp than other year mille. I have a clean title in hand. I'm asking $3500 obo. Any questions please feel free to call or text. Check out my other listings.

1000 CC V twin Aprilia Tuono.  Extremely rare and powerful motorcycle with more than enough low end torque and horsepower.  Has a more upright seating position compared to most sport bikes that makes it more comfortable for longer rides, but aggressive and powerful enough to get into the twisties and lift the front wheel in just about any gear if you desire.  All stock with the exception of upgraded Leo Vince exhaust system, cleaner license plate holder, clear turn signal lenses and frame sliders.  Adult owned, garage kept and never laid down.  New rear tire.  Low miles.  Passenger seat and seat cowl included.  Great bike, meticulously maintained, no mechanical issues.  Cash only, no trades.  Test rides with cash in hand.  I'll include front and rear wheel stands for maintenance and an armored leather jacked if interested.  Located in the Mount Vernon area of Alexandria.

Selling my 2005 Kawaski Concours ZG1000. Bike is in impeccable condition. You will have to see it!
23000 miles, always garaged, never down, zero damage, no scratches, no rust! I have owned the bike since 2012 when I purchased it from it's original owner. Purchased as a backup bike she just does not get much use anymore since I don't ride as much as I used to..
Here are some of the things that I have done since I have owned her:
I removed the carbs and had them redone by: https://sites.google.com/site/shoodabenengineering/home
The carbs were cleaned, rejetted, overflow protection installed and sinked. I also purchased their new cams that were installed by Zebra Racing in " Marsh", VA. The bike was dino tuned for maximum efficiency. I am not a speed racer but I enjoy a well running
machine. ( you can read about the tuning philosophy on the shoodabenengineering website (link above).
Since I am 5' 11" with a 34"inseam I made a few further adjustments. 
I installed handlebar risers and lowering pegs as well as handlebar weights. All of that allows the rider to decompress and sit more upright. The bar weights reduce vibration. The bike currently has the short windshield installed (pictured). I do have the original touring windshield as well.
The tires are in great shape, maybe 1500 miles on them.. No maintenance needed, just get on it and ride.
 I hate to see her go but would be happy to see her on the road more often. Will entertain reasonable offers.

Selling my 2005 Kawaski Concours ZG1000. Bike is in impeccable condition. You will have to see it!
23000 miles, always garaged, never down, zero damage, no scratches, no rust! I have owned the bike since 2012 when I purchased it from it's original owner. Purchased as a backup bike she just does not get much use anymore since I don't ride as much as I used to..
Here are some of the things that I have done since I have owned her:
I removed the carbs and had them redone by: https://sites.google.com/site/shoodabenengineering/home
The carbs were cleaned, rejetted, overflow protection installed and sinked. I also purchased their new cams that were installed by Zebra Racing in " Marsh", VA. The bike was dino tuned for maximum efficiency. I am not a speed racer but I enjoy a well running
machine. ( you can read about the tuning philosophy on the shoodabenengineering website (link above).
Since I am 5' 11" with a 34"inseam I made a few further adjustments. 
I installed handlebar risers and lowering pegs as well as handlebar weights. All of that allows the rider to decompress and sit more upright. The bar weights reduce vibration. The bike currently has the short windshield installed (pictured). I do have the original touring windshield as well.
The tires are in great shape, maybe 1500 miles on them.. No maintenance needed, just get on it and ride.
 I hate to see her go but would be happy to see her on the road more often. Will entertain reasonable offers.

The tires are in great shape, maybe 1500 miles on them.. No maintenance needed, just get on it and ride.
 I hate to see her go but would be happy to see her on the road more often. Will entertain reasonable offers.

Selling my 2005 Kawaski Concours ZG1000. Bike is in impeccable condition. You will have to see it!
23000 miles, always garaged, never down, zero damage, no scratches, no rust! I have owned the bike since 2012 when I purchased it from it's original owner. Purchased as a backup bike she just does not get much use anymore since I don't ride as much as I used to..
Here are some of the things that I have done since I have owned her:
I removed the carbs and had them redone by: https://sites.google.com/site/shoodabenengineering/home
The carbs were cleaned, rejetted, overflow protection installed and sinked. I also purchased their new cams that were installed by Zebra Racing in " Marsh", VA. The bike was dino tuned for maximum efficiency. I am not a speed racer but I enjoy a well running
machine. ( you can read about the tuning philosophy on the shoodabenengineering website (link above).
Since I am 5' 11" with a 34"inseam I made a few further adjustments. 
I installed handlebar risers and lowering pegs as well as handlebar weights. All of that allows the rider to decompress and sit more upright. The bar weights reduce vibration. The bike currently has the short windshield installed (pictured). I do have the original touring windshield as well.
The tires are in great shape, maybe 1500 miles on them.. No maintenance needed, just get on it and ride.
 I hate to see her go but would be happy to see her on the road more often. Will entertain reasonable offers.

$4500 no trades. Super clean GSX-R 1000. I'm the second owner and the original owner was my cousin. It's been kept at my house since originally purchased and has been regularly tuned and maintained. Only 10XXX miles on it. I'm only looking to sell it for what I paid him, plus what I paid to fix it. This bike is near new, and is stock, aside from the exhaust slip-on and Lo-jack. Let me know if you are interested. No low ball offered will be considered and no trades! Thanks Edward  show contact info

Add-ons: (1) Givi Crash bar, (2) PIAA auxiliary lights, (3)Madstad windshield mount (better air-low and less buffeting), (4) Givi mounting rack for side case V35 (sorry but I keep the cases that I will put on my other bike). I bought another bike and cannot keep two, so I have to let this one go. Great for long trips (went to Montreal, Tail of the Dragon). I will also give-up the TPMS since it does not fit on the current bike.

Bike is ready to ride! 
I have side fairings which are included in this deal. They are currently off of the motorcycle as I like the ''naked" look.

Bike has been meticulously looked after.  Very clean for a 15 year old bike.  I believe I am the third owner.  Has 29k miles. Oil/filter changed regularly.  New radiator, oil seal, water pump seal, impeller, impeller bearing and Metzeler M3 rear tire. 

Puig Race Windscreen
Custom tank risers
Two Brothers C4 cans
K&N Air filter
Fender eliminator
HeliBars handlebar risers
Buell footpegs which lower them 1"
Adjustable clutch and brake levers
Mirror spacers 
TechSpec tank grips
GrimmSpeed color match BBS STI gold wheel paint

The bad...
There are a few rips in the seats.
This bike runs with two headlights on at the same time.  One of them is out and needs to be replaced.  It is an LED kit I had to purchase for both headlights.  One side still works fine and hasn't effected visibility at all which is why I haven't bothered with it.
The blinkers hyperflash.  Did not want to install the relays.  I have the relays but I like the speed of the flashers.
The paint on the rear wheel looks like some of the chain lube must've baked onto it.  Doesn't look horrible, but bothers me.

Just put $1000 into it.

I'm looking for any information about my ZX-10r which was stolen from Back Bay this summer. If anyone has seen this bike, I would deeply appreciate any information you could share with me. A link to a FB ad, whereabouts, etc could all help in recovering this bike, especially as it gets colder out.  

Integrated taillights make this motorcycle stand out. It also has some damage to the rear stand pegs as well. Pictures are of the bike. 

Sorry to distract from you finding your new wheels- Thank you very much for your help!

Hi, I'm reposting this bike due to a sale that did not fall through. The bike is very nice. I rode it for 2.5 seasons without any issues whatsoever, I only turned a wrench on the bike when I wanted to. The bike has too much done to list, but I'll try. Driven performance race clutch kit, shorty adjustable levers, moto gp exhaust (bike is insainly loud, I also have a yoshi muffler to go with the purchase), increased flow air filter, many many cosmetics, ect. The bike has 37k on it, valves were done 2k ago, I believe I have the paperwork. Mechanic said the motor looked incredible with no signs of wear (I believe that's in the write up for the valves). The only bad thing about the bike is it could probably use an oil change (I can do it before the purchase for a few extra bucks). And there probably about 1 more season left on the tires under normal riding conditions. This will be my last time trying to sell this bike for this price, if it doesn't sell I'll keep it for the winter and just sell it for more come spring. Any questions feel free to call/text  show contact info
, it is rare that I check/ respond to emails. Thanks!

Rare Exotic High Performance Beauty!  Ride something different! Only a handful in the country!  2003 Aprilia Caponord ETV1000 Adventure.  100HP Rotax V-twin.  Timeless design still looks fresh and exotic. Bike is FAST.  Easily keep pace with 1000cc crotch rockets, then take dirt roads home!  This bike is know to be very reliable after a few issues are sorted.  Many examples over 100k miles.  Guess what.... I've sorted all the issues.  New Honda CBR1000 Mosfet rectifier installed for good battery charging. Plastic fuel fittings that leak replaced with stainless steel.  New coils.  Fuel injection vacuum lines replaced.  This bike is rock solid reliable.  I wouldn't hesitate to head across the country on it!  Recently did the Vermont Puppy Dog Route and the Trans Mass Trail on it. No high maintenance Italian girlfriend here! Looks awesome!  Runs awesome! Parts still easily available. Total setup for full adventure riding:  Givi locking trunk, soft side bags, tank cover and tank bag.  Bags come off in moments and you have a sports bike. Updated mirrors and LED rear turn signals. Selling because I am a man-child who can't control adrenaline craving and shouldn't own something this sporty for road rides.  Consider trades toward BMW or KTM adventure bike.

Beautiful low mileage.  Original owner.  Runs perfectly. Always garaged.  Includes steering damper pictured.  Never crashed or raced. There's a dent in the left side of the tank from falling over against a curb.  The dent is covered by the Arai sticker in the photo.   I removed all the badges and stickers when I got it. 

Tires are Michelin Pilots and are in great shape. 

Also including a Leo Vince stainless exhaust.  Pictured.  

It is equipped with Heli bars that raise the grips about 2" from stock.  The stock bars are included.  Pictured.

I am the second owner of the bike and have changed the oil and filter every spring no matter how little I have driven it and 2 seasons ago changed all fluids.

The bike has never been down and really fun to ride. Only aftermarket parts are Odin bar end mirrors and Yoshimura exhaust.

The bike is border line flawless.

Hello,
 Posting my 2003 FZ1 up for sale. Got the bike about 2 years ago and it's time to switch to a cruiser. This naked bike is basically an R1 for the real world, comfortable but still incredibly fast and nimble.

Great condition and low milage (14,200). It's a carbureted bike so takes a minute to warm up if the weather is under 60. Other than that, runs like a champ. This earlier version has better acceleration than the newer fuel injected ones.

Inspection, oil change and brand new tires at the beginning of the season.
Indoor winter storage and covered in the summer.
Very comfortable with bar riser for taller people.

Looks like the previous owner had a 0 speed parking lot drop. Some horizontal scrapes on the bar end. No dents and all alignments checked by my mechanic. I commute on 95 a few days a week and there's not even a hint of a shake.

My sacrifice is your win to own an awesome bike !  I'm selling my 2007 CBR 1000RR motorcycle. This bike is all muscle and not to be under estimated. This bike has new tires with 500 miles on them, new battery and totally pampered throughout. 12,000 miles currently but am still riding this season until the first snow flake. I also am selling my 2003 Suzuki Volusia 800 in excellent condition with 23,000 miles. Oil has been changed every 3,000 miles regularly. New battery was installed this Summer. Both bikes are road ready and need absolutely nothing to ride. I am firm on $5,000.00 for my CBR 1000RR. If you were to be interested in both bikes as one purchase my price is $7,500.00. The Suzuki is NOT available for sale by itself only.

Hello,
 Posting my 2003 FZ1 up for sale. Got the bike about 2 years ago and it's time to switch to a cruiser. This naked bike is basically an R1 for the real world, comfortable but still incredibly fast and nimble.

Great condition and low milage (14,200). It's a carbureted bike so takes a minute to warm up if the weather is under 60. Other than that, runs like a champ. This earlier version has better acceleration than the newer fuel injected ones.

Inspection, oil change and brand new tires at the beginning of the season.
Indoor winter storage and covered in the summer.
Very comfortable with bar riser for taller people.

Looks like the previous owner had a 0 speed parking lot drop. Some horizontal scrapes on the bar end. No dents and all alignments checked by my mechanic. I commute on 95 a few days a week and there's not even a hint of a shake.

Bike has been meticulously looked after.  Very clean for a 15 year old bike.  I believe I am the third owner.  Has 29k miles. Oil/filter changed regularly.  New radiator, oil seal, water pump seal, impeller, impeller bearing and Metzeler M3 rear tire. 

Puig Race Windscreen
Custom tank risers
Two Brothers C4 cans
K&N Air filter
Fender eliminator
HeliBars handlebar risers
Buell footpegs which lower them 1"
Adjustable clutch and brake levers
Mirror spacers 
TechSpec tank grips
GrimmSpeed color match BBS STI gold wheel paint

The bad...
There are a few rips in the seats.
This bike runs with two headlights on at the same time.  One of them is out and needs to be replaced.  It is an LED kit I had to purchase for both headlights.  One side still works fine and hasn't effected visibility at all which is why I haven't bothered with it.
The blinkers hyperflash.  Did not want to install the relays.  I have the relays but I like the speed of the flashers.
The paint on the rear wheel looks like some of the chain lube must've baked onto it.  Doesn't look horrible, but bothers me.

Just put $1000 into it.
$2000 or best offer.
Email works best.

I'm looking for any information about my ZX-10r which was stolen from Back Bay this summer. If anyone has seen this bike, I would deeply appreciate any information you could share with me. A link to a FB ad, whereabouts, etc could all help in recovering this bike, especially as it gets colder out.  

Integrated taillights make this motorcycle stand out. It also has some damage to the rear stand pegs as well. Pictures are of the bike. 

Sorry to distract from you finding your new wheels- Thank you very much for your help!

Hi, I'm reposting this bike due to a sale that did not fall through. The bike is very nice. I rode it for 2.5 seasons without any issues whatsoever, I only turned a wrench on the bike when I wanted to. The bike has too much done to list, but I'll try. Driven performance race clutch kit, shorty adjustable levers, moto gp exhaust (bike is insainly loud, I also have a yoshi muffler to go with the purchase), increased flow air filter, many many cosmetics, ect. The bike has 37k on it, valves were done 2k ago, I believe I have the paperwork. Mechanic said the motor looked incredible with no signs of wear (I believe that's in the write up for the valves). The only bad thing about the bike is it could probably use an oil change (I can do it before the purchase for a few extra bucks). And there probably about 1 more season left on the tires under normal riding conditions. This will be my last time trying to sell this bike for this price, if it doesn't sell I'll keep it for the winter and just sell it for more come spring. Any questions feel free to call/text  show contact info
, it is rare that I check/ respond to emails. Thanks!

Rare Exotic High Performance Beauty!  Ride something different! Only a handful in the country!  2003 Aprilia Caponord ETV1000 Adventure.  100HP Rotax V-twin.  Timeless design still looks fresh and exotic. Bike is FAST.  Easily keep pace with 1000cc crotch rockets, then take dirt roads home!  This bike is know to be very reliable after a few issues are sorted.  Many examples over 100k miles.  Guess what.... I've sorted all the issues.  New Honda CBR1000 Mosfet rectifier installed for good battery charging. Plastic fuel fittings that leak replaced with stainless steel.  New coils.  Fuel injection vacuum lines replaced.  This bike is rock solid reliable.  I wouldn't hesitate to head across the country on it!  Recently did the Vermont Puppy Dog Route and the Trans Mass Trail on it. No high maintenance Italian girlfriend here! Looks awesome!  Runs awesome! Parts still easily available. Total setup for full adventure riding:  Givi locking trunk, soft side bags, tank cover and tank bag.  Bags come off in moments and you have a sports bike. Updated mirrors and LED rear turn signals. Selling because I am a man-child who can't control adrenaline craving and shouldn't own something this sporty for road rides.  Consider trades toward BMW or KTM adventure bike.

Also including a Leo Vince stainless exhaust.  Pictured.  

It is equipped with Heli bars that raise the grips about 2" from stock.  The stock bars are included.  Pictured.

I am the second owner of the bike and have changed the oil and filter every spring no matter how little I have driven it and 2 seasons ago changed all fluids.

The bike has never been down and really fun to ride. Only aftermarket parts are Odin bar end mirrors and Yoshimura exhaust.

The bike is border line flawless.
Will entertain some trades, would take a lake boat, the right Miata ot something with an LS motor.

I also am selling my 2003 Suzuki Volusia 800 in excellent condition with 23,000 miles. Oil has been changed every 3,000 miles regularly. New battery was installed this Summer. Both bikes are road ready and need absolutely nothing to ride. I am firm on $5,000.00 for my CBR 1000RR. If you were to be interested in both bikes as one purchase my price is $7,500.00. The Suzuki is NOT available for sale by itself only.

Hello,
 Posting my 2003 FZ1 up for sale. Got the bike about 2 years ago and it's time to switch to a cruiser. This naked bike is basically an R1 for the real world, comfortable but still incredibly fast and nimble.

Great condition and low milage (14,200). It's a carbureted bike so takes a minute to warm up if the weather is under 60. Other than that, runs like a champ. This earlier version has better acceleration than the newer fuel injected ones.

Inspection, oil change and brand new tires at the beginning of the season.
Indoor winter storage and covered in the summer.
Very comfortable with bar riser for taller people.

Looks like the previous owner had a 0 speed parking lot drop. Some horizontal scrapes on the bar end. No dents and all alignments checked by my mechanic. I commute on 95 a few days a week and there's not even a hint of a shake.

Bike has been meticulously looked after.  Very clean for a 15 year old bike.  I believe I am the third owner.  Has 29k miles. Oil/filter changed regularly.  New radiator, oil seal, water pump seal, impeller, impeller bearing and Metzeler M3 rear tire. 

Puig Race Windscreen
Custom tank risers
Two Brothers C4 cans
K&N Air filter
Fender eliminator
HeliBars handlebar risers
Buell footpegs which lower them 1"
Adjustable clutch and brake levers
Mirror spacers 
TechSpec tank grips
GrimmSpeed color match BBS STI gold wheel paint

The bad...
There are a few rips in the seats.
This bike runs with two headlights on at the same time.  One of them is out and needs to be replaced.  It is an LED kit I had to purchase for both headlights.  One side still works fine and hasn't effected visibility at all which is why I haven't bothered with it.
The blinkers hyperflash.  Did not want to install the relays.  I have the relays but I like the speed of the flashers.
The paint on the rear wheel looks like some of the chain lube must've baked onto it.  Doesn't look horrible, but bothers me.

Just put $1000 into it.

I'm looking for any information about my ZX-10r which was stolen from Back Bay this summer. If anyone has seen this bike, I would deeply appreciate any information you could share with me. A link to a FB ad, whereabouts, etc could all help in recovering this bike, especially as it gets colder out.  

Integrated taillights make this motorcycle stand out. It also has some damage to the rear stand pegs as well. Pictures are of the bike. 

Sorry to distract from you finding your new wheels- Thank you very much for your help!

Hi, I'm reposting this bike due to a sale that did not fall through. The bike is very nice. I rode it for 2.5 seasons without any issues whatsoever, I only turned a wrench on the bike when I wanted to. The bike has too much done to list, but I'll try. Driven performance race clutch kit, shorty adjustable levers, moto gp exhaust (bike is insainly loud, I also have a yoshi muffler to go with the purchase), increased flow air filter, many many cosmetics, ect. The bike has 37k on it, valves were done 2k ago, I believe I have the paperwork. Mechanic said the motor looked incredible with no signs of wear (I believe that's in the write up for the valves). The only bad thing about the bike is it could probably use an oil change (I can do it before the purchase for a few extra bucks). And there probably about 1 more season left on the tires under normal riding conditions. This will be my last time trying to sell this bike for this price, if it doesn't sell I'll keep it for the winter and just sell it for more come spring. Any questions feel free to call/text  show contact info
, it is rare that I check/ respond to emails. Thanks!

Rare Exotic High Performance Beauty!  Ride something different! Only a handful in the country!  2003 Aprilia Caponord ETV1000 Adventure.  100HP Rotax V-twin.  Timeless design still looks fresh and exotic. Bike is FAST.  Easily keep pace with 1000cc crotch rockets, then take dirt roads home!  This bike is know to be very reliable after a few issues are sorted.  Many examples over 100k miles.  Guess what.... I've sorted all the issues.  New Honda CBR1000 Mosfet rectifier installed for good battery charging. Plastic fuel fittings that leak replaced with stainless steel.  New coils.  Fuel injection vacuum lines replaced.  This bike is rock solid reliable.  I wouldn't hesitate to head across the country on it!  Recently did the Vermont Puppy Dog Route and the Trans Mass Trail on it. No high maintenance Italian girlfriend here! Looks awesome!  Runs awesome! Parts still easily available. Total setup for full adventure riding:  Givi locking trunk, soft side bags, tank cover and tank bag.  Bags come off in moments and you have a sports bike. Updated mirrors and LED rear turn signals. Selling because I am a man-child who can't control adrenaline craving and shouldn't own something this sporty for road rides.  Consider trades toward BMW or KTM adventure bike.

Beautiful low mileage.  Original owner.  Runs perfectly. Always garaged.  Includes steering damper pictured.  Never crashed or raced. There's a dent in the left side of the tank from falling over against a curb.  The dent is covered by the Arai sticker in the photo.   I removed all the badges and stickers when I got it. 

Tires are Michelin Pilots and are in great shape. 

Also including a Leo Vince stainless exhaust.  Pictured.  

It is equipped with Heli bars that raise the grips about 2" from stock.  The stock bars are included.  Pictured.

Bike currently has 5,9XX miles on it. Everything works as it should, tires are in decent shape. 

I am the second owner of the bike and have changed the oil and filter every spring no matter how little I have driven it and 2 seasons ago changed all fluids.

The bike has never been down and really fun to ride. Only aftermarket parts are Odin bar end mirrors and Yoshimura exhaust.

The bike is border line flawless.
Will entertain some trades, would take a lake boat, the right Miata ot something with an LS motor.

My sacrifice is your win to own an awesome bike !  I'm selling my 2007 CBR 1000RR motorcycle. This bike is all muscle and not to be under estimated. This bike has new tires with 500 miles on them, new battery and totally pampered throughout. 12,000 miles currently but am still riding this season until the first snow flake. I also am selling my 2003 Suzuki Volusia 800 in excellent condition with 23,000 miles. Oil has been changed every 3,000 miles regularly. New battery was installed this Summer. Both bikes are road ready and need absolutely nothing to ride. I am firm on $5,000.00 for my CBR 1000RR. If you were to be interested in both bikes as one purchase my price is $7,500.00. The Suzuki is NOT available for sale by itself only.

2005 Ducati 999 Superbike BLACK Dyno All Receipts

$4850

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 Ducati 999 Biposto Testastretta Superbike BLACK Dyno All Receipts.

Title from Florida signed over to me on October 7, 2017. I never registered the Ducati in Connecticut. Rode only 30-miles and kept in my garage with my 1988 Ducati 750 Paso. Chain of Ownership will be documented by transfer of Ownership on the Florida Title that has been signed over to me, and also, a Connecticut Bill of Sale showing exchange of Ownership. Have sold a few Collectible Motorcycles over the years and the Chain-of Ownership documentation is all that is needed to transfer Title.

There are no Leaks, No Smoke, No Excuses, Nothing needed. Out of all the Motorcycles I have owned over the past 40-years, this is the most powerful, lightweight, beautiful, and best designed, as only Italy could have provided. Have owned a 1979 Honda CBX (6-cylinder), a 1978 Benelli 750 SEI (6-cylinder), and 15 others- this Ducati 999 is the BEST, Hands down.

Weighs 402-pounds, Produces 127.64 hp at the rear wheel; 72.51 ft. lbs torque (See DynoJet Performance Output Sheet). Performance is capable of producing more smiles than a face can register. Really.

Have ALL receipts and Service Records, Including the original "Pre-Delivery Checklist".

Also, I do have the Owner's Manual and Red Key. In early 2000 models (up until recently in 2007/08), Ducati motorcycles came with keys that have a specialized anti-theft device. Similar to RFID (key-fobs, electronic strikes), these keys send a unique signal (each key blank will have it's own unique signal) to the motorcycle's computer which are required for operation of the bike using the stock ECU.  Black keys are used to start the bike. When the bike turns on it will read the signal from the black key and a valid signal is required before the bike will start. Red keys are primarily used to program the ECU to accept new signals. It's false that a red key is required for any service on your bike (unless that service is specifically programming new keys into the stock ECU). 

$ 6,000 spent on Service and Upgrades." $ 4,921. spent on 6,000- mile service. Always used Synthetic Oil. Installed Ducati Dynojet Power Commander PC ($ 360), Leo-Vance Cat Eliminator ( $180.), and Leo-Vance Slip-On-Kit ( $ 2,039).

The 6,000 service receipt included:

Hi, I'm reposting this bike due to a sale that did not fall through. The bike is very nice. I rode it for 2.5 seasons without any issues whatsoever, I only turned a wrench on the bike when I wanted to. The bike has too much done to list, but I'll try. Driven performance race clutch kit, shorty adjustable levers, moto gp exhaust (bike is insainly loud, I also have a yoshi muffler to go with the purchase), increased flow air filter, many many cosmetics, ect. The bike has 37k on it, valves were done 2k ago, I believe I have the paperwork. Mechanic said the motor looked incredible with no signs of wear (I believe that's in the write up for the valves). The only bad thing about the bike is it could probably use an oil change (I can do it before the purchase for a few extra bucks). And there probably about 1 more season left on the tires under normal riding conditions. This will be my last time trying to sell this bike for this price, if it doesn't sell I'll keep it for the winter and just sell it for more come spring. Any questions feel free to call/text  show contact info
, it is rare that I check/ respond to emails. Thanks!

Rare Exotic High Performance Beauty!  Ride something different! Only a handful in the country!  2003 Aprilia Caponord ETV1000 Adventure.  100HP Rotax V-twin.  Timeless design still looks fresh and exotic. Bike is FAST.  Easily keep pace with 1000cc crotch rockets, then take dirt roads home!  This bike is know to be very reliable after a few issues are sorted.  Many examples over 100k miles.  Guess what.... I've sorted all the issues.  New Honda CBR1000 Mosfet rectifier installed for good battery charging. Plastic fuel fittings that leak replaced with stainless steel.  New coils.  Fuel injection vacuum lines replaced.  This bike is rock solid reliable.  I wouldn't hesitate to head across the country on it!  Recently did the Vermont Puppy Dog Route and the Trans Mass Trail on it. No high maintenance Italian girlfriend here! Looks awesome!  Runs awesome! Parts still easily available. Total setup for full adventure riding:  Givi locking trunk, soft side bags, tank cover and tank bag.  Bags come off in moments and you have a sports bike. Updated mirrors and LED rear turn signals. Selling because I am a man-child who can't control adrenaline craving and shouldn't own something this sporty for road rides.  Consider trades toward BMW or KTM adventure bike.

Beautiful low mileage.  Original owner.  Runs perfectly. Always garaged.  Includes steering damper pictured.  Never crashed or raced. There's a dent in the left side of the tank from falling over against a curb.  The dent is covered by the Arai sticker in the photo.   I removed all the badges and stickers when I got it. 

Tires are Michelin Pilots and are in great shape. 

Also including a Leo Vince stainless exhaust.  Pictured.  

It is equipped with Heli bars that raise the grips about 2" from stock.  The stock bars are included.  Pictured.

Bike currently has 5,9XX miles on it. Everything works as it should, tires are in decent shape. 

I am the second owner of the bike and have changed the oil and filter every spring no matter how little I have driven it and 2 seasons ago changed all fluids.

The bike has never been down and really fun to ride. Only aftermarket parts are Odin bar end mirrors and Yoshimura exhaust.

The bike is border line flawless.
Will entertain some trades, would take a lake boat, the right Miata ot something with an LS motor.

2005 Yamaha YZF-R1 with 9870 miles in great running condition. Bike was laid over on its left side but the left frame slider took the brunt of the fall. It was assessed by Moroney's Cycle of New Windsor, NY and was reported to be left with only cosmetic damage. The damage cost was quoted to be more than the book value of the bike so even though the title is still clean, I will be selling it with the damage disclosure statement checked off on the back of the title, which will render it "rebuilt" once it is registered in the buyer's name. I can provide a copy of the damage estimate to those seriously interested. The bike will pass inspection and ride perfectly. As it sits, it would make the perfect track bike but with new fairings and a tank, it could be a great road bike again too. It could also use a new shifter and left mirror. The engine casing is slightly filed down as well as the swingarm but nothing serious, no cracks. The bike comes with a Scorpion exhaust and a rear tire with low miles on it, as well as a brand new front tire (both Michelin Pilot Power II). Oil changed every 2,000 miles with Mobil 1 full synthetic, ran only 93 octane. Also an anodized gas cap was fitted on the bike so it comes with the OEM cap too. The bike does not come with the stands. 

Very quick machine, technically the lightest of all the R1 generations and very noticeable. Potentially an awesome deal for the right person. 

If serious about the bike, please look at the photos carefully and ask me any questions you might have. NO TRADES will be entertained, CASH ONLY. Thank you!

This is a 2004 Suzuki V Strom DL1000. Its in really nice shape, as you can see in the photos. The engine runs and sounds great. The battery was recently replaced, the fuel injectors were cleaned, and the throttle body was sync'd. The bike has an accessory wire/plug for a heated jacket, and a 12V charger port for your cell or GPS. A few things worth mentioning are: some of the minor/accessory plastics have cracks: the left hand grip guard (see photo), both plastic nuts around the base of the mirrors (they function just fine). I think this is pretty common among V-Stroms. They were there when I got it. Also, the tank has a very small linear dent (also pictured). Bike does not come with the center stand. 

I would consider trades for a civic/corolla or other cars.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking.

I have decided to sell my 2004 Ducati Monster 1000s.  I bought it as an "upgrade" over my 1997 Monster 750 but after 2 summers of riding both, I still prefer my older Duc so it's time to let the newer bike go.  The bike is in nearly pristine condition and runs strong.  It is a very quick bike with fuel injection.  It shares the styling of the original Monsters but without the headache of carbs and that makes it pretty unique in the Monster family.  The bike only has 2689 miles and has received all regular scheduled maintenance.  No scratches on the tank, or tears in the seat.  It has aftermarket Renthal bars but I also have the original stock bars if you want them.  The only thing the bike needs is new front rotors.  The front brakes pulse when stopping: not enough to impair driveability but I find it annoying and would replace the rotors if I were keeping the bike.  Pictures show current condition.

The bike can be inspected at my house on weekends.  It is tagged and insured and can be test driven by serious buyers with appropriate gear.  If you are interested, please reply by email through Craigslist and put "Ducati" in the subject line.

Thanks for looking.

Hi, I'm reposting this bike due to a sale that did not fall through. The bike is very nice. I rode it for 2.5 seasons without any issues whatsoever, I only turned a wrench on the bike when I wanted to. The bike has too much done to list, but I'll try. Driven performance race clutch kit, shorty adjustable levers, moto gp exhaust (bike is insainly loud, I also have a yoshi muffler to go with the purchase), increased flow air filter, many many cosmetics, ect. The bike has 37k on it, valves were done 2k ago, I believe I have the paperwork. Mechanic said the motor looked incredible with no signs of wear (I believe that's in the write up for the valves). The only bad thing about the bike is it could probably use an oil change (I can do it before the purchase for a few extra bucks). And there probably about 1 more season left on the tires under normal riding conditions. This will be my last time trying to sell this bike for this price, if it doesn't sell I'll keep it for the winter and just sell it for more come spring. Any questions feel free to call/text  show contact info
, it is rare that I check/ respond to emails. Thanks!

Rare Exotic High Performance Beauty!  Ride something different! Only a handful in the country!  2003 Aprilia Caponord ETV1000 Adventure.  100HP Rotax V-twin.  Timeless design still looks fresh and exotic. Bike is FAST.  Easily keep pace with 1000cc crotch rockets, then take dirt roads home!  This bike is know to be very reliable after a few issues are sorted.  Many examples over 100k miles.  Guess what.... I've sorted all the issues.  New Honda CBR1000 Mosfet rectifier installed for good battery charging. Plastic fuel fittings that leak replaced with stainless steel.  New coils.  Fuel injection vacuum lines replaced.  This bike is rock solid reliable.  I wouldn't hesitate to head across the country on it!  Recently did the Vermont Puppy Dog Route and the Trans Mass Trail on it. No high maintenance Italian girlfriend here! Looks awesome!  Runs awesome! Parts still easily available. Total setup for full adventure riding:  Givi locking trunk, soft side bags, tank cover and tank bag.  Bags come off in moments and you have a sports bike. Updated mirrors and LED rear turn signals. Selling because I am a man-child who can't control adrenaline craving and shouldn't own something this sporty for road rides.  Consider trades toward BMW or KTM adventure bike.

There's a dent in the left side of the tank from falling over against a curb.  The dent is covered by the Arai sticker in the photo.   I removed all the badges and stickers when I got it. 

Tires are Michelin Pilots and are in great shape. 

Also including a Leo Vince stainless exhaust.  Pictured.  

It is equipped with Heli bars that raise the grips about 2" from stock.  The stock bars are included.  Pictured.

Bike currently has 5,9XX miles on it. Everything works as it should, tires are in decent shape. 

I am the second owner of the bike and have changed the oil and filter every spring no matter how little I have driven it and 2 seasons ago changed all fluids.

The bike has never been down and really fun to ride. Only aftermarket parts are Odin bar end mirrors and Yoshimura exhaust.

The bike is border line flawless.
Will entertain some trades, would take a lake boat, the right Miata ot something with an LS motor.

Hello,
 Posting my 2003 FZ1 up for sale. Got the bike about 2 years ago and it's time to switch to a cruiser. This naked bike is basically an R1 for the real world, comfortable but still incredibly fast and nimble.

Great condition and low milage (14,200). It's a carbureted bike so takes a minute to warm up if the weather is under 60. Other than that, runs like a champ. This earlier version has better acceleration than the newer fuel injected ones.

Inspection, oil change and brand new tires at the beginning of the season.
Indoor winter storage and covered in the summer.
Very comfortable with bar riser for taller people.

Looks like the previous owner had a 0 speed parking lot drop. Some horizontal scrapes on the bar end. No dents and all alignments checked by my mechanic. I commute on 95 a few days a week and there's not even a hint of a shake.

Bike has been meticulously looked after.  Very clean for a 15 year old bike.  I believe I am the third owner.  Has 29k miles. Oil/filter changed regularly.  New radiator, oil seal, water pump seal, impeller, impeller bearing and Metzeler M3 rear tire. 

Puig Race Windscreen
Custom tank risers
Two Brothers C4 cans
K&N Air filter
Fender eliminator
HeliBars handlebar risers
Buell footpegs which lower them 1"
Adjustable clutch and brake levers
Mirror spacers 
TechSpec tank grips
GrimmSpeed color match BBS STI gold wheel paint

The bad...
There are a few rips in the seats.
This bike runs with two headlights on at the same time.  One of them is out and needs to be replaced.  It is an LED kit I had to purchase for both headlights.  One side still works fine and hasn't effected visibility at all which is why I haven't bothered with it.
The blinkers hyperflash.  Did not want to install the relays.  I have the relays but I like the speed of the flashers.
The paint on the rear wheel looks like some of the chain lube must've baked onto it.  Doesn't look horrible, but bothers me.

Just put $1000 into it.

I'm looking for any information about my ZX-10r which was stolen from Back Bay this summer. If anyone has seen this bike, I would deeply appreciate any information you could share with me. A link to a FB ad, whereabouts, etc could all help in recovering this bike, especially as it gets colder out.  

Integrated taillights make this motorcycle stand out. It also has some damage to the rear stand pegs as well. Pictures are of the bike. 

Sorry to distract from you finding your new wheels- Thank you very much for your help!

My sacrifice is your win to own an awesome bike !  I'm selling my 2007 CBR 1000RR motorcycle. This bike is all muscle and not to be under estimated. This bike has new tires with 500 miles on them, new battery and totally pampered throughout. 12,000 miles currently but am still riding this season until the first snow flake. I also am selling my 2003 Suzuki Volusia 800 in excellent condition with 23,000 miles. Oil has been changed every 3,000 miles regularly. New battery was installed this Summer. Both bikes are road ready and need absolutely nothing to ride. I am firm on $5,000.00 for my CBR 1000RR. If you were to be interested in both bikes as one purchase my price is $7,500.00. The Suzuki is NOT available for sale by itself only.

For Sale/Trade: 2005 Ducati Monster S4R

I present for sale my 2005 Ducati Monster S4R that I have owned for 2 years (4500 miles ridden).  It is in excellent condition, with routine maintenance up-to-date.  The only blemishes on the bike are cosmetic and consist of some minor scratches on the tank and fairings.  To highlight the well-kept nature of the bike, in 2017 the timing belts and oil were both changed.  Then, this spring and summer I installed a new battery and new tires (Pirelli Diablo Rosso 2).  I have records and receipts of the maintenance done during my ownership.  The bike has never been down and the only hiccup in my ownership of it was a failed voltage regulator; internet searching will show this is a common problem for Ducatis of this vintage.  It was addressed by installing an aftermarket MOSFET-type voltage regulator, which is a more reliable unit than the OEM SCR-type regulators.

The previous owner of the bike performed some common aftermarket modifications that are frequently found on these bikes:

- Arrow Titanium Exhaust (it is very loud and sounds great)
- Tail tidy with integrated brake light and turn signals
- Rizoma exposed clutch basket
- Rizoma bar-end mirrors
- Rizoma grips

I do have all OEM components that were taken off the bike during the installation of the aftermarket parts and they will be included with the sale along with the owner's manual, service manual, and the red key (this is used to reprogram additional keys).  I also have a cover for the bike, disc lock, and chain lock that I am happy to include for no additional cost.  

I am selling the bike because I simply do not ride enough to justify continued ownership.  I really want to find a good home for it with someone who will enjoy it as much as I have over the past couple of years.

I will consider trades for a car/truck with a manual transmission or even a pick-up truck/SUV.  Please do not hesitate to ask questions

For Sale or Trade: 2005 Ducati Monster S4R

$4500

QR Code Link to This Post


I present for sale my 2005 Ducati Monster S4R that I have owned for 2 years (4500 miles ridden). It is in excellent condition, with routine maintenance up-to-date. The only blemishes on the bike are cosmetic and consist of some minor scratches on the tank and fairings. To highlight the well-kept nature of the bike, in 2017 the timing belts and oil were both changed. Then, this spring and summer I installed a new battery and new tires (Pirelli Diablo Rosso 2). I have records and receipts of the maintenance done during my ownership. The bike has never been down and the only hiccup in my ownership of it was a failed voltage regulator; internet searching will show this is a common problem for Ducatis of this vintage. It was addressed by installing an aftermarket MOSFET-type voltage regulator, which is a more reliable unit than the OEM SCR-type regulators.

The previous owner of the bike performed some common aftermarket modifications that are frequently found on these bikes:

- Arrow Titanium Exhaust (it is very loud and sounds great)
- Tail tidy with integrated brake light and turn signals
- Rizoma exposed clutch basket
- Rizoma bar-end mirrors
- Rizoma grips

I do have all OEM components that were taken off the bike during the installation of the aftermarket parts and they will be included with the sale along with the owner's manual, service manual, and the red key (this is used to reprogram additional keys). I also have a cover for the bike, disc lock, and chain lock that I am happy to include for no additional cost. 

I am selling the bike because I simply do not ride enough to justify continued ownership. I really want to find a good home for it with someone who will enjoy it as much as I have over the past couple of years.

I will consider trades for a car/truck with a manual transmission or even a pick-up truck/SUV. Please do not hesitate to ask questions

Wow...
I'd like to thank all the assholes who have their computers that "automatically" respond to ANY posting on Craigslist! Thanks so much for wasting my time!! 
Hopefully there's a few (actually it only takes 1) people who would actually enjoy riding a nice road ready motorcycle??
Phil.... that's the secret word "PHIL", if your emails don't say "Hey Phil I'm interested" then don't waste my time

Runs and rides great, recently had tuned on dyno.  Stretched 12 inches.  Good tires, power commander tuner.  Rear suspension is at its highest setting, but can be lowered with 1 bolt.  Bike is nasty fast, but can also be tame enough to commute everyday.  Need nothing ready to ride.  Just in time for end of summer and fall riding.

I'm selling my 2003 Suzuki. I'm the second owner. The bike came to me from Florida. It got dropped in transit resulting in the front damage. It has been a great bike. I got it with 28,000 and currently it is at 32,262 miles. I upgraded brakes, shifters, foot pegs, hand levers, chain, rear wheel bearings, oil changes and basic maintenance. 1000cc 1.0 liter V style engine. Very torquey. Zero gravity windshield. Lots of bolt ons. Rear light delete. Great bike for for the price.

This bike is mechanically sound and extremely fast, it has its minor imperfections but I have transformed it into a very good looking bike over the last couple of years.
Im interested in cash and trades ,i.e. Harley or a mustang . I don't need to sell it just looking to get something a bit more enjoyable to cruise . I also don't need help selling it .

For Sale/Trade: 2005 Ducati Monster S4R

$4500

QR Code Link to This Post


I present for sale my 2005 Ducati Monster S4R that I have owned for 2 years (4500 miles ridden).  It is in excellent condition, with routine maintenance up-to-date.  The only blemishes on the bike are cosmetic and consist of some minor scratches on the tank and fairings.  To highlight the well-kept nature of the bike, in 2017 the timing belts and oil were both changed.  Then, this spring and summer I installed a new battery and new tires (Pirelli Diablo Rosso 2).  I have records and receipts of the maintenance done during my ownership.  The bike has never been down and the only hiccup in my ownership of it was a failed voltage regulator; internet searching will show this is a common problem for Ducatis of this vintage.  It was addressed by installing an aftermarket MOSFET-type voltage regulator, which is a more reliable unit than the OEM SCR-type regulators.

The previous owner of the bike performed some common aftermarket modifications that are frequently found on these bikes:

- Arrow Titanium Exhaust (it is very loud and sounds great)
- Tail tidy with integrated brake light and turn signals
- Rizoma exposed clutch basket
- Rizoma bar-end mirrors
- Rizoma grips

I do have all OEM components that were taken off the bike during the installation of the aftermarket parts and they will be included with the sale along with the owner's manual, service manual, and the red key (this is used to reprogram additional keys).  I also have a cover for the bike, disc lock, and chain lock that I am happy to include for no additional cost.  

I am selling the bike because I simply do not ride enough to justify continued ownership.  I really want to find a good home for it with someone who will enjoy it as much as I have over the past couple of years.

I will consider trades for a car/truck with a manual transmission or even a pick-up truck/SUV.  Please do not hesitate to ask questions
