Hey guys up for grabs is my 05 gsxr 750. This bike is super clean and super fun. It's got extremely low miles only 7,500. Tires are perfect brakes everything. Just had fresh tune up. I dropped it one time when I tried starting it in gear hence the black paint on the front and new frame sliders. It does have full yoshi exhaust from headers to tip. This bike is super clean. I'll take a trade on stupid clean truck or cars preferably manual. I would rather have cash. 3000 obo

QR Code Link to This Post


2005 GSXR 600(750)

Pros
-I've owned this bike since new. Original and only owner. Still have the manual.  
-A couple years ago I switched out the original 600 engine to a 750.  Switched over computer and air box. It only has 12000 miles since then. 
-Thing runs as smooth as butter. Only reason I'm selling is I bought a new bike and have no need for two. As much as I hate to see her go she's ready for a new home!  

-cons
--Small dent  on gas tank(left)
--back brake master cylinder is bad got a few estimates roughly $120-140 to replace with installation. But seeing as I have no need to fix it and don't use the back brake anyway when I ride I just took this into consideration with the listing price

Extras
I have new clutch plates I never got around to installing because I got my new bike before it needed to be replaced. and an oil filter and a couple other things.  And if you need I have a stand as well 


Please don't lowball me, I know what I have and I don't need the money.  Will consider reasonable cash offers. No checks no wires and no I don't need your help selling my bike!   954-613-088zero text is best

Hey guys up for grabs is my 05 gsxr 750. This bike is super clean and super fun. It's got extremely low miles only 7,500. Tires are perfect brakes everything. Just had fresh tune up. I dropped it one time when I tried starting it in gear hence the black paint on the front and new frame sliders. It does have full yoshi exhaust from headers to tip. This bike is super clean. I'll take a trade on stupid clean truck or cars preferably manual. I would rather have cash. 3000 obo
