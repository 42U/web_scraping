2007 GSX-R 1000 Beautiful Bike And Extras!

$5500

QR Code Link to This Post


This Beautiful Orange and Black Bike is ready for a new owner. I have the clean title in hand and the total mileage is very low at around 12,700. It comes with an after market exhaust which makes this bike sound like a beast instead of the typical high pitched sound from other bullet bikes. It's super fast and very powerful, you won't be disappointed. I'm selling it with riding shoes, a riding jacket, two helmets (male L and female M) and also with a bike stand and a tank bag. More pictures to come. Selling for cash only. Bike only for $5,200. Price not negotiable.

2007 GSXR for sale 

It is lowered, has steering stabilizers, adjustable clutch and brake levers and full yoshi carbon exhaust and carbon frame sliders

The only issue the bike has is at wide open throttle past 7k it feels like it hits fuel cut which I believe to be the fuel pump dying, if you ride it normally it runs fine and doesn't do anything weird. 

16k miles $5800 obo. May be interested in trades and cash on your end if it's a 600 depending on what it is.

$5500

QR Code Link to This Post


This Beautiful Orange and Black Bike is ready for a new owner. I have the clean title in hand and the total mileage is very low at around 12,700. It comes with an after market exhaust which makes this bike sound like a beast instead of the typical high pitched sound from other bullet bikes. It's super fast and very powerful, you won't be disappointed. I'm selling it with riding shoes, a riding jacket, two helmets (male L and female M) and also with a bike stand and a tank bag. More pictures to come. Selling for cash only. Bike only for $5,200. Price not negotiable.

Letting go of a 2007 GSX-R 1000 with low miles. Just a week ago, the gas light is on and stays on.  I've been told it's a $250 parts and service - I'm reflecting this in the asking price. 

-6900 miles
-Yoshimura carbon fiber slip-on exhaust (bought the exhaust from a third-party who did the damage), works and sounds fantastic
-Sato racing black rear sets, has serious grip 
-Garage kept
-This motorcycle is maintained, starts up immediately and garage kept
-Clean NJ title in hand
-2 sets of keys

Selling my K6 gsxr 1000 with all original paperwork and clean title, hate to see it go but I hardly ride anymore (11,000mi) and would like to see the bike go to a good home. Very well maintained with 1500mi oil changes using full synthetic 4T oil (includes 2 extra oil filters). new ebc brake pads, m4 exhaust, k&n filter, pc5 with m4 map, bazazz TRE, and other things i'm forgetting. have original parts (seat, passenger pegs, windscreen, plate mount), never crashed or dropped (original plastics in great condition). Slightly negotiable on price, Thank you.

$5500

QR Code Link to This Post


This Beautiful Orange and Black Bike is ready for a new owner. I have the clean title in hand and the total mileage is very low at around 12,700. It comes with an after market exhaust which makes this bike sound like a beast instead of the typical high pitched sound from other bullet bikes. It's super fast and very powerful, you won't be disappointed. I'm selling it with riding shoes, a riding jacket, two helmets (male L and female M) and also with a bike stand and a tank bag. More pictures to come. Selling for cash only. Bike only for $5,200. Price not negotiable.
